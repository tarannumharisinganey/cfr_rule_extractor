#### (c) Valuation of Underwriting Compensation

# (1) Limitation on Securities Received Upon Exercise or Conversion of Another Security

A participating member may not receive a security (including securities in a unit), a warrant for a security, or a security convertible into another security as underwriting compensation in connection with a public offering unless:

- (A) the security received or the security underlying the warrant or convertible security received is identical to the security offered to the public or to a security with a bona fide public market; or
  - (B) the security can be accurately valued, as required by paragraph (g)(1) of this Rule.

## (2) Valuation of Non-Convertible Securities

Non-convertible securities received as underwriting compensation will have a compensation value based on:

- (A) the difference between:
- (i) either the market price per security on the date of acquisition, or, if no bona fide public market exists for the security, the public offering price per security; and
  - (ii) the per security cost;
- (B) multiplied by the number of securities received or to be received as underwriting compensation;
- (C) divided by the offering proceeds; and
- (D) multiplied by one hundred.

# (3) Valuation of Convertible Securities

Options, warrants or convertible securities ("warrants") shall have a compensation value based on the following formula:

- (A) the public offering price per security multiplied by .65;
- (B) minus the resultant of the exercise or conversion price per warrant less either:
  - (i) the market price per security on the date of acquisition, where a bona fide public market exists for the security; or
  - (ii) the public offering price per security;
- (C) divided by two;
- (D) multiplied by the number of securities underlying the warrants;
- (E) less the total price paid for the warrants;
- (F) divided by the offering proceeds; and
- (G) multiplied by one hundred;
- (H) provided, however, that, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4) of this Rule, such warrants shall have a compensation value of at least .2% of the offering proceeds for each amount of securities that is up to 1% of the securities being offered to the public (excluding securities subject to an overallotment option).

#### (4) Reduction in Valuation

If a participating member wishes to reduce the proposed maximum value of any securities received as underwriting compensation, it may do so by voluntarily agreeing to lock-up such securities for successive 180-day periods (in addition to the initial lock-up period required by paragraph (e) of this Rule if applicable). Each additional 180-day period will reduce the proposed maximum value attributable to such securities by 10%.

# (5) Valuation of Securities Acquired in Connection with a Fair Price Non-Convertible or Non-Exchangeable Debt or Derivative Instrument

Any non-convertible or non-exchangeable debt or derivative instrument acquired or entered into at a "fair price" as defined in Supplementary Material .06(b) and underwriting compensation received in or receivable in the settlement, exercise or other terms of such nonconvertible or non-exchangeable debt or derivative instrument shall not have a compensation value for purposes of determining underwriting compensation. If the actual price for the non-convertible or non-exchangeable debt or derivative instrument is not a fair price, compensation will be calculated pursuant to this paragraph (c) or based on the difference between the fair price and the actual price

#### (d) Securities Acquisitions Not Considered Underwriting Compensation

Securities acquired in transactions that meet the requirements of this paragraph (d) are excluded from underwriting compensation and not subject to the lock-up requirements of paragraph (e)(1), provided that the member does not condition its participation in the public offering on an acquisition of securities in a transaction that meets the requirements of this paragraph and any securities acquired are acquired at the same price and with the same terms as the securities purchased by all other investors.

## (c) Definitions

- (1) The term "listed securities" means securities that are traded on the national securities exchanges identified in Securities Act Rule 146, on markets registered with the SEC under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, and on any "designated offshore securities market" as defined in Rule 902(b) of SEC Regulation S.
- (2) The term "right of pre-emption" means the right of a shareholder to acquire additional securities in the same company in order to avoid dilution when additional securities are issued, pursuant to: (A) any option, shareholder agreement, or other contractual right entered into at the time of purchase of securities; (B) the terms of the securities purchased; (C) the issuer's charter or by-laws; or (D) the domestic law of a foreign jurisdiction that regulates the issuance of the securities.
- .02 Venture Capital Transactions and Significantly Delayed Offerings. Notwithstanding paragraph (d), in the event that an offering is significantly delayed and the issuer needs funding pending consummation of the public offering, FINRA may exclude from underwriting compensation any securities acquired in a transaction that otherwise meets the requirements in paragraph (d), but occurs after the required filing date. To determine whether an acquisition of securities that occurs after the required filing date may be excluded from underwriting compensation, FINRA will consider the following factors, as well as any other relevant factors and circumstances:
- (a) the length of time between the required filing of the registration statement or similar document and the date of the transaction in which securities were acquired;
- (b) the length of time between the date of the transaction in which the securities were acquired and the anticipated commencement of the public offering; and
  - (c) the nature of the funding provided, including, but not limited to the issuer's need for funding before the public offering.
- .03 Underwriting Compensation Securities Acquired Other than from the Issuer. Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(22), FINRA may exclude securities acquired from a third-party entity from underwriting compensation. To determine whether an acquisition of securities from a thirdparty entity may be excluded from underwriting compensation, FINRA will consider the following factors, as well as any other relevant factors and circumstances:

- (a) the nature of the relationship between the issuer and the third party, if any;
- (b) the nature of the transactions in which the securities were acquired, including, but not limited to, whether the transactions are engaged in as part of the participating member's ordinary course of business; and
  - (c) any disparity between the price paid and the offering price or market price.
- .04 Underwriting Compensation Resulting from Issuer Directed Sales Programs. Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(15) and (22), FINRA may exclude from underwriting compensation securities acquired by a participating member's associated persons or their immediate family pursuant to an issuer directed sales program. To determine whether an acquisition of securities by a participating member's associated persons or their immediate family pursuant to an issuer directed sales program may be excluded from underwriting compensation, FINRA will consider the following factors, as well as any other relevant factors and circumstances:
  - (a) the existence of a pre-existing relationship between the issuer and the person acquiring the securities;
  - (b) the nature of the relationship; and
- (c) whether the securities were acquired on the same terms and at the same price as other similarly-situated persons participating in the directed sales program.
- .05 Disclosure of Underwriting Compensation. A description of each item of underwriting compensation received or to be received by a participating member must be disclosed in the section on distribution arrangements in the prospectus (or other similar offering document). The description shall include the dollar amount ascribed to each individual item of compensation. When securities are acquired by a participating member, material terms and arrangements of the acquisition must also be disclosed in the section on distribution arrangements in the prospectus (or other similar offering document) when applicable, such as exercise terms, demand and piggyback registration rights and lock-up periods that may apply. Similarly, if underwriting compensation consists of a right of first refusal to participate in the distribution of a future public offering, private placement or other financing, the description should reference the existence of such right and its duration.

# .06 Non-Convertible or Non-Exchangeable Debt Securities and Derivatives

- (a) Non-convertible or non-exchangeable debt securities and derivative instruments acquired in a transaction related to the public offering and at a fair price, will be considered underwriting compensation but will have no compensation value. Non-convertible or non-exchangeable debt securities and derivative instruments acquired in a transaction related to the public offering but not at a fair price, will be considered underwriting compensation and subject to the normal valuation requirements of this Rule.
- (b) The term "derivative instrument" means any "eligible OTC derivative instrument" as defined in SEA Rule 3b-13(a)(1), (2) and (3). The term "fair price" means the participating members have priced a derivative instrument or non-convertible or non-exchangeable debt security in good faith; on an arm's length, commercially reasonable basis, and in accordance with pricing methods and models and procedures used in the ordinary course of their business for pricing similar transactions. A derivative instrument or other security received as compensation for providing services for the issuer, for providing or arranging a loan, credit facility, merger, acquisition or any other service, including underwriting services will not be deemed to be entered into or acquired at a fair price.
- .07 Venture Capital Transactions. The determination of whether a securities acquisition may be excluded from underwriting compensation pursuant to paragraph (d) is to be made at the time of the securities acquisition.

The current annual amount fixed by the Board of Governors is \$100. 1
