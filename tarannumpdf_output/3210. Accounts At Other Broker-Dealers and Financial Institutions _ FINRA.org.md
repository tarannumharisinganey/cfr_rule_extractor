## 3210.AccountsAtOtherBroker-Dealers and Financial Institutions

- (a) No person associated with a member ("employer member") shall, without the prior written consent of the member, open or otherwise establish at a member other than the employer member ("executing member"), or at any other financial institution, any account in which securities transactions can be effected and in which the associated person has a beneficial interest.
- (b) Any associated person, prior to opening or otherwise establishing an account subject to this Rule, shall notify in writing the executing member, or other financial institution, of his or her association with the employer member.
- (c) An executing member shall, upon written request by an employer member, transmit duplicate copies of confirmations and statements, or the transactional data contained therein, with respect to an account subject to this Rule.
- • Supplementary Material: ------------------
- .01 Account Opened Prior to Association With Employer Member. If the account was opened or otherwise established prior to the person's association with the employer member, the associated person, within 30 calendar days of becoming so associated, shall obtain the written consent of the employer member to maintain the account and shall notify in writing the executing member or other financial institution of his or her association with the employer member.
- .02 Related and Other Persons. For purposes of this Rule, the associated person shall be presumed to have a beneficial interest in, and to have established, any account that is held by:
  - (a) the spouse of the associated person;
- (b) a child of the associated person or of the associated person's spouse, provided that the child resides in the same household as or is financially dependent upon the associated person;
  - (c) any other related individual over whose account the associated person has control; or
- (d) any other individual over whose account the associated person has control and to whose financial support the associated person materially contributes.

For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Supplementary Material .02, an associated person need not be presumed to have a beneficial interest in, or to have established, an account if the associated person demonstrates, to the reasonable satisfaction of the employer member, that the associated person derives no economic benefit from, and exercises no control over, the account.

- .03 Transactions and Accounts Not Subject To This Rule. The requirements of this Rule shall not apply to transactions in unit investment trusts, municipal fund securities as defined under MSRB Rule D-12, qualified tuition programs pursuant to Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code and variable contracts or redeemable securities of companies registered under the Investment Company Act, as amended, or to accounts that are limited to transactions in such securities, or to Monthly Investment Plan type accounts.
- .04 Accounts At a Financial Institution Other Than a Member. With respect to an account subject to this Rule at a financial institution other than a member, the employer member shall consider the extent to which it will be able to obtain, upon written request, duplicate copies of confirmations and statements, or the transactional data contained therein, directly from the non-member financial institution in determining whether to provide its written consent to an associated person to open or maintain such account.
- .05 Other Financial Institution. For purposes of this Rule, the terms "other financial institution" and "financial institution other than a member" include, but are not limited to, any broker-dealer that is registered pursuant to Section 15(b)(11) of the Exchange Act, domestic or foreign nonmember broker-dealer, investment adviser, bank, insurance company, trust company, credit union and investment company.
