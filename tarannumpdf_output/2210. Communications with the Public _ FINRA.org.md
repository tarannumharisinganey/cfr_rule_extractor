Such procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that institutional communications comply with applicable standards. When such procedures do not require review of all institutional communications prior to first use or distribution, they must include provision for the education and training of associated persons as to the firm's procedures governing institutional communications, documentation of such education and training, and surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to.

## (d) Content Standards

### (1) General Standards

- (A) All member communications must be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith, must be fair and balanced, and must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts in regard to any particular security or type of security, industry, or service. No member may omit any material fact or qualification if the omission, in light of the context of the material presented, would cause the communications to be misleading.
- (B) No member may make any false, exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory or misleading statement or claim in any communication. No member may publish, circulate or distribute any communication that the member knows or has reason to know contains any untrue statement of a material fact or is otherwise false or misleading.
- (C) Information may be placed in a legend or footnote only in the event that such placement would not inhibit an investor's understanding of the communication.
- (D) Members must ensure that statements are clear and not misleading within the context in which they are made, and that they provide balanced treatment of risks and potential benefits. Communications must be consistent with the risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainty of dividends, rates of return and yield inherent to investments.
- (E) Members must consider the nature of the audience to which the communication will be directed and must provide details and explanations appropriate to the audience.
- (F) Communications may not predict or project performance, imply that past performance will recur or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast; provided, however, that this paragraph (d)(1)(F) does not prohibit:
  - (i) A hypothetical illustration of mathematical principles, provided that it does not predict or project the performance of an investment or investment strategy;
  - (ii) An investment analysis tool, or a written report produced by an investment analysis tool, that meets the requirements of Rule 2214; and
  - (iii) A price target contained in a research report on debt or equity securities, provided that the price target has a reasonable basis, the report discloses the valuation methods used to determine the price target, and the price target is accompanied by disclosure concerning the risks that may impede achievement of the price target.

#### (2) Comparisons

Any comparison in retail communications between investments or services must disclose all material differences between them, including (as applicable) investment objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, safety, guarantees or insurance, fluctuation of principal or return, and tax features.

#### (3) Disclosure of Member's Name

All retail communications and correspondence must:

- (A) prominently disclose the name of the member, or the name under which the member's broker-dealer business primarily is conducted as disclosed on the member's Form BD, and may also include a fictional name by which the member is commonly recognized or which is required by any state or jurisdiction;
  - (B) reflect any relationship between the member and any non-member or individual who is also named; and
  - (C) if it includes other names, reflect which products or services are being offered by the member.

This paragraph (d)(3) does not apply to so-called "blind" advertisements used to recruit personnel.

## (4) Tax Considerations

- (A) In retail communications and correspondence, references to tax-free or tax-exempt income must indicate which income taxes apply, or which do not, unless income is free from all applicable taxes. If income from an investment company investing in municipal bonds is subject to state or local income taxes, this fact must be stated, or the illustration must otherwise make it clear that income is free only from federal income tax.
- (B) Communications may not characterize income or investment returns as tax-free or exempt from income tax when tax liability is merely postponed or deferred, such as when taxes are payable upon redemption.
- (C) A comparative illustration of the mathematical principles of tax-deferred versus taxable compounding must meet the following requirements:
  - (i) The illustration must depict both the taxable investment and the tax-deferred investment using identical investment amounts and identical assumed gross investment rates of return, which may not exceed 10 percent per annum.
    - (ii) The illustration must use and identify actual federal income tax rates.
  - (iii) The illustration may reflect an actual state income tax rate, provided that the communication prominently discloses that the illustration is applicable only to investors that reside in the identified state.
  - (iv) Tax rates used in an illustration that is intended for a target audience must reasonably reflect its tax bracket or brackets as well as the tax character of capital gains and ordinary income.
  - (v) If the illustration covers the payout period for an investment, the illustration must reflect the impact of taxes during this period.
    - (vi) The illustration may not assume an unreasonable period of tax deferral.
    - (vii) The illustration must disclose, as applicable:
    - a. the degree of risk in the investment's assumed rate of return, including a statement that the assumed rate of return is not guaranteed;
    - b. the possible effects of investment losses on the relative advantage of the taxable versus the tax-deferred investments;
      - c. the extent to which tax rates on capital gains and dividends would affect the taxable investment's return;
      - d. the fact that ordinary income tax rates will apply to withdrawals from a tax-deferred investment;
      - e. its underlying assumptions;
    - f. the potential impact resulting from federal or state tax penalties (e.g., for early withdrawals or use on non-qualified expenses); and
    - g. that an investor should consider his or her current and anticipated investment horizon and income tax bracket when making an investment decision, as the illustration may not reflect these factors.

#### (5) Disclosure of Fees, Expenses and Standardized Performance

- (A) Retail communications and correspondence that present non-money market fund open-end management investment company performance data as permitted by Securities Act Rule 482 and Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act must disclose:
  - (i) the standardized performance information mandated by Securities Act Rule 482 and Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act; and
    - (ii) to the extent applicable:
    - a. the maximum sales charge imposed on purchases or the maximum deferred sales charge, as stated in the investment company's prospectus current as of the date of distribution or submission for publication of a communication; and
    - b. the total annual fund operating expense ratio, gross of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements, as stated in the fee table of the investment company's prospectus described in paragraph (d)(5)(A)(ii)(a).

(B) All of the information required by paragraph (d)(5)(A) must be set forth prominently, and in any print advertisement, in a prominent text box that contains only the required information and, at the member's option, comparative performance and fee data and disclosures required by Securities Act Rule 482 and Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act.

## (6) Testimonials

- (A) If any testimonial in a communication concerns a technical aspect of investing, the person making the testimonial must have the knowledge and experience to form a valid opinion.
- (B) Retail communications or correspondence providing any testimonial concerning the investment advice or investment performance of a member or its products must prominently disclose the following:
  - (i) The fact that the testimonial may not be representative of the experience of other customers.
  - (ii) The fact that the testimonial is no guarantee of future performance or success.
  - (iii) If more than \$100 in value is paid for the testimonial, the fact that it is a paid testimonial.

# (7) Recommendations

- (A) Retail communications that include a recommendation of securities must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation and must disclose, if applicable, the following:
  - (i) that at the time the communication was published or distributed, the member was making a market in the security being recommended, or in the underlying security if the recommended security is an option or security future, or that the member or associated persons will sell to or buy from customers on a principal basis;
  - (ii) that the member or any associated person that is directly and materially involved in the preparation of the content of the communication has a financial interest in any of the securities of the issuer whose securities are recommended, and the nature of the financial interest (including, without limitation, whether it consists of any option, right, warrant, future, long or short position), unless the extent of the financial interest is nominal; and
  - (iii) that the member was manager or co-manager of a public offering of any securities of the issuer whose securities are recommended within the past 12 months.
- (B) A member must provide, or offer to furnish upon request, available investment information supporting the recommendation. When a member recommends a corporate equity security, the member must provide the price at the time the recommendation is made.
- (C) A retail communication or correspondence may not refer, directly or indirectly, to past specific recommendations of the member that were or would have been profitable to any person; provided, however, that a retail communication or correspondence may set out or offer to furnish a list of all recommendations as to the same type, kind, grade or classification of securities made by the member within the immediately preceding period of not less than one year, if the communication or list:
  - (i) states the name of each such security recommended, the date and nature of each such recommendation (e.g., whether to buy, sell or hold), the market price at that time, the price at which the recommendation was to be acted upon, and the market price of each such security as of the most recent practicable date; and
  - (ii) contains the following cautionary legend, which must appear prominently within the communication or list: "it should not be assumed that recommendations made in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of the securities in this list."
  - (D)(i) This paragraph (d)(7) does not apply to any communication that meets the definition of "research report" for purposes of Rule 2241 or that meets the definition of "debt research report" for purposes of Rule 2242, and includes all of the disclosures required by Rule 2241 or 2242, as applicable.
  - (ii) Paragraphs (d)(7)(A) and (d)(7)(C) do not apply to any communication that recommends only registered investment companies or variable insurance products; provided, however, that such communications must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation.

#### (8) BrokerCheck

- (A) Each of a member's websites must include a readily apparent reference and hyperlink to BrokerCheck on:
  - (i) the initial webpage that the member intends to be viewed by retail investors; and
- (ii) any other webpage that includes a professional profile of one or more registered persons who conduct business with retail investors.

# (e) Limitations on Use of FINRA's Name and Any Other Corporate Name Owned by FINRA

Members may indicate FINRA membership in conformity with Article XV, Section 2 of the FINRA By-Laws in one or more of the following ways:

- (1) in any communication that complies with the applicable standards of this Rule and neither states nor implies that FINRA, or any other corporate name or facility owned by FINRA, or any other regulatory organization endorses, indemnifies, or guarantees the member's business practices, selling methods, the class or type of securities offered, or any specific security, and provided further that any reference to the Department's review of a communication is limited to either "Reviewed by FINRA" or "FINRA Reviewed";
- (2) in a confirmation statement for an over-the-counter transaction that states: "This transaction has been executed in conformity with the FINRA Uniform Practice Code"; and
- (3) on a member's website, provided that the member provides a hyperlink to FINRA's internet home page, www.finra.org, in close proximity to the member's indication of FINRA membership. A member is not required to provide more than one such hyperlink on its website. If the member's website contains more than one indication of FINRA membership, the member may elect to provide any one hyperlink in close proximity to any reference reasonably designed to draw the public's attention to FINRA membership. This provision also shall apply to an internet website relating to the member's investment banking or securities business maintained by or on behalf of any person associated with a member.

#### (f) Public Appearances

- (1) When sponsoring or participating in a seminar, forum, radio or television interview, or when otherwise engaged in public appearances or speaking activities that are unscripted and do not constitute retail communications, institutional communications or correspondence ("public appearance"), persons associated with members must follow the standards of paragraph (d)(1).
- (2) If an associated person recommends a security in a public appearance, the associated person must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation. The associated person also must disclose, as applicable:
  - (A) that the associated person has a financial interest in any of the securities of the issuer whose securities are recommended, and the nature of the financial interest (including, without limitation, whether it consists of any option, right, warrant, future, long or short position), unless the extent of the financial interest is nominal; and
  - (B) any other actual, material conflict of interest of the associated person or member of which the associated person knows or has reason to know at the time of the public appearance.
- (3) Each member shall establish written procedures that are appropriate to its business, size, structure, and customers to supervise its associated persons' public appearances. Such procedures must provide for the education and training of associated persons who make public appearances as to the firm's procedures, documentation of such education and training, and surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to. Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must be maintained and made available to FINRA upon request.
- (4) Any scripts, slides, handouts or other written (including electronic) materials used in connection with public appearances are considered communications for purposes of this Rule, and members must comply with all applicable provisions of this Rule based on those communications' audience, content and use.

Paragraph (f)(2) also does not apply to a recommendation of investment company securities or variable insurance products; provided, however, that the associated person must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation.
