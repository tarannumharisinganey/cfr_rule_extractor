## (d) 
FINRA may release information already publicly disseminated through the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database about a BrokerCheck Associated Person currently associated with a BrokerCheck Firm who is, or was, licensed as an investment adviser representative.

## (e) 
Eligible parties may dispute the accuracy of certain information disclosed through FINRA BrokerCheck pursuant to the administrative process described below:
  - (1) Initiation of a Dispute
  - (A) The following persons (each an "eligible party") may initiate a dispute regarding the accuracy of information disclosed in that eligible party's BrokerCheck report:
    - (i) any current BrokerCheck Firm;
    - (ii) any former BrokerCheck Firm, provided that the dispute is submitted by a natural person who served as the former BrokerCheck Firm's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer or Chief Compliance Officer, or individual with similar status or function, as identified on Schedule A of Form BD at the time the former BrokerCheck Firm ceased being registered with FINRA or a CRD Exchange; or
    - (iii) any BrokerCheck Associated Person currently associated with a BrokerCheck Firm or BrokerCheck Associated Person who was formerly associated with a BrokerCheck Firm for whom a BrokerCheck report is available.
  - (B) To initiate a dispute, an eligible party must submit a written notice to FINRA, in such manner and format that FINRA may require, identifying the alleged inaccurate factual information and explaining the reason that such information is allegedly inaccurate. The eligible party must submit with the written notice all available supporting documentation.
  - (2) Determination of Disputes Eligible for Investigation
  - (A) FINRA will presume that a dispute of factual information is eligible for investigation unless FINRA reasonably determines that the facts and circumstances involving the dispute suggest otherwise.

- (B) If FINRA determines that a dispute is eligible for investigation, FINRA will, except in circumstances involving court-ordered expungement, add a general notation to the eligible party's BrokerCheck report stating that the eligible party has disputed certain information included in the report. The notation will be removed from the eligible party's BrokerCheck report upon resolution of the dispute by FINRA. In disputes involving a court order to expunge information from BrokerCheck, FINRA will prevent the disputed information from being displayed via BrokerCheck while FINRA evaluates the matter.
- (C) If FINRA determines that a dispute is not eligible for investigation, it will notify the eligible party of this determination in writing, including a brief description of the reason for the determination. A determination by FINRA that a dispute is not eligible for investigation is not subject to appeal.
- (3) Investigation and Resolution of Disputes
- (A) If FINRA determines that the written notice and supporting documentation submitted by the eligible party is sufficient to update, modify or remove the information that is the subject of the request, FINRA will make the appropriate change. If the written notice and supporting documentation do not include sufficient information upon which FINRA can make a determination, FINRA, under most circumstances, will contact the entity that reported the disputed information (the "reporting entity") to the CRD system and request that the reporting entity verify that the information, as disclosed through BrokerCheck, is accurate in content and presentation. If a reporting entity other than FINRA is involved, FINRA will defer to the reporting entity about whether the information received is accurate. If the reporting entity acknowledges that the information is not accurate, FINRA will update, modify or remove the information, as appropriate, based on the information provided by the reporting entity. If the reporting entity confirms that the information is accurate in content and presentation or the reporting entity no longer exists or is otherwise unable to verify the accuracy of the information, FINRA will not change the information.
  - (B) FINRA will notify the eligible party in writing that the investigation has resulted in a determination that:
    - (i) the information is inaccurate or not accurately presented and has been updated, modified or deleted;
    - (ii) the information is accurate in content and presentation and no changes have been made; or
    - (iii) the accuracy of the information or its presentation could not be verified and no changes have been made.
- (C) A determination by FINRA, including a determination to leave unchanged or to modify or delete disputed information, is not subject to appeal.
## (f) 
Upon written request, FINRA may provide a compilation of information about FINRA members, subject to terms and conditions established by FINRA and after execution of a licensing agreement prepared by FINRA. FINRA may charge commercial users of such information reasonable fees as determined by FINRA. Such compilations shall consist solely of information selected by FINRA from Forms BD and BDW and shall be limited to information that is otherwise publicly available from the SEC.
## (g) 
FINRA shall not release:
- (1) information reported as a Social Security number, residential history, physical description, the street address of a registered location identified as a private residence, information that FINRA is otherwise prohibited from releasing under Federal law, or information that is provided solely for use by regulators. FINRA reserves the right to exclude, on a case-by-case basis, information that contains confidential customer information, offensive or potentially defamatory language or information that raises significant identity theft, personal safety or privacy concerns that are not outweighed by investor protection concerns;
  - (2) information reported on Registration Forms relating to regulatory investigations or proceedings if the reported regulatory investigation or proceeding was vacated or withdrawn by the instituting authority;
    - (3) "Internal Review Disclosure" information reported on Section 7 of the Form U5;
    - (4) "Reason for Termination" information reported on Section 3 of the Form U5;
  - (5) events reported on Section 7 of the Form U5 (other than an "Internal Review Disclosure" event) for three business days after FINRA's processing of the filing. However, if an event is reported on Form U5 and the same event is thereafter reported on Form U4 prior to the expiration of the three-business-day period, FINRA will release the Forms U4 and U5 information simultaneously upon processing. Under such circumstances, the three-business-day period may be curtailed;
    - (6) the most recent information reported on a Registration Form, if:
    - (A) FINRA has determined that the information was reported in error by a BrokerCheck Firm, regulator or other appropriate authority;

- (B) the information has been determined by regulators, through amendments to the uniform Registration Forms, to be no longer relevant to securities registration or licensure, regardless of the disposition of the event or the date the event occurred;
- (7) information provided on Schedule E of Form BD.
