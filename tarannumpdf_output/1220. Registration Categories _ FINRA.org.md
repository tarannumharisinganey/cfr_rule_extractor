- c. the disclosures required by paragraph (b)(6)(A)(iii)b. of this Rule shall be presented on the front page of the research report or the front page shall refer to the page on which the disclosures can be found.

- d. members shall establish and maintain records that identify those individuals who have availed themselves of this exemption, the basis for such exemption, and evidence of compliance with the conditions of the exemption.

- e. nothing in paragraph (b)(6) of this Rule shall affect the obligation of any person or broker-dealer, including a foreign broker-dealer, to comply with the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws, rules and regulations and any selfregulatory organization rules;
- f. the fact that a foreign research analyst avails himself or herself of the exemption in paragraph (b)(6) of this Rule shall not be probative of whether that individual is an associated person of the member for other purposes, including whether the foreign research analyst is subject to the Rule [2241](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2241) restrictions on communications with a subject company, public appearances and trading securities held by a research analyst account;
- g. a member that distributes non-member foreign affiliate research reports that are clearly and prominently labeled as such must comply with the third-party research report requirements in Rule [2241;](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2241) and

# • • • Supplementary Material: --------------

.01 Foreign Registrations. Persons who are in good standing as a representative with the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom or with a Canadian stock exchange or securities regulator shall be exempt from the requirement to pass the SIE.

.02 Additional Qualification Requirements for Persons Engaged in Security Futures Activities. Each person who is registered with FINRA as a General Securities Representative, United Kingdom Securities Representative, Canada Securities Representative, Options Representative, Registered Options Principal or General Securities Sales Supervisor shall be eligible to engage in security futures activities as a representative or principal, as applicable, provided that such individual completes a Firm Element program as set forth in Rule [1240](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/1240) that addresses security futures products before such person engages in security futures activities.

.03 Members With One Registered Options Principal. A member that has one Registered Options Principal shall promptly notify FINRA in the event such person is terminated, resigns, becomes incapacitated or is otherwise unable to perform the duties of a Registered Options Principal.

Following receipt of such notification, FINRA shall require the member to agree, in writing, to refrain from engaging in any options-related activities that would necessitate the prior or subsequent approval of a Registered Options Principal until such time as a new Registered Options Principal has been qualified.

Members failing to qualify a new Registered Options Principal within two weeks following the loss of their sole Registered Options Principal, or by the earliest available date for administration of the Registered Options Principal examination, whichever is longer, shall be required to cease doing an options business; provided, however, they may effect closing transactions in options to reduce or eliminate existing open options positions in their own account as well as the accounts of their customers.

.04 Scope of General Securities Sales Supervisor Registration Category. The General Securities Sales Supervisor category is an alternate category of registration designed to lessen the qualification burdens on principals of general securities firms who supervise sales. Without this category of limited registration, such principals would be required to separately qualify pursuant to the rules of FINRA, the MSRB, the NYSE and the options exchanges. While persons may continue to separately qualify with all relevant self-regulatory organizations, the General Securities Sales Supervisor examinations permit qualification as a supervisor of sales of all securities through one registration category. Persons registered as General Securities Sales Supervisors may also qualify in any other category of principal registration. Persons who are already qualified in one or more categories of principal registration may supervise sales activities of all securities by also qualifying as General Securities Sales Supervisors.

Any person required to be registered as a principal who supervises sales activities in corporate, municipal and option securities, investment company products, variable contracts, direct participation program securities as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(A) of this Rule, and security futures (subject to the requirements of Supplementary Material .02 of this Rule) may be registered solely as a General Securities Sales Supervisor. In addition to branch office managers, other persons such as regional and national sales managers may also be registered solely as General Securities Sales Supervisors as long as they supervise only sales activities.

.05 Scope of Operations Professional Requirement. Any person whose activities are limited to performing a function ancillary to a covered function specified in paragraph (b)(3)(A)(ii) of this Rule, or whose function is to serve a role that can be viewed as supportive of or advisory to the performance of a covered function specified in paragraph (b)(3)(A)(ii) of this Rule (e.g., internal audit, legal or compliance personnel who review

but do not have primary responsibility for any covered function), or who engages solely in clerical or ministerial activities in a covered function specified in paragraph (b)(3)(A)(ii) of this Rule shall not be required to register as an Operations Professional. For the purpose of paragraph (b)(3) (A)(i)c. of this Rule, the determination as to what constitutes "materially" or "material" is based on a member's pre-established spending guidelines and risk management policies.

An employee of a foreign broker-dealer whose activities, relating to a transaction in foreign securities on behalf of a customer of a member, are limited to facilitating the clearance and settlement of the transaction shall not be required to register as an Operations Professional where:

- (a) the member sending the order for a transaction in foreign securities on behalf of the customer to the foreign broker-dealer is not a direct participant of the applicable foreign clearing system; and
- (b) in executing such order in the foreign market, the foreign broker-dealer accepts the member's customer's instructions to settle the transaction in foreign securities on a DVP/RVP basis through the foreign clearing system and settle directly with a custodian for the customer.

However, if persons registered in such categories subsequently terminate such registration(s) with FINRA and the registration remains terminated for two or more years, they shall not be eligible to re-register in such categories. In addition, each person who is registered with FINRA as a Foreign Associate on October 1, 2018 shall be eligible to maintain such registration with FINRA. However, if persons registered as Foreign Associates subsequently terminate such registrations with FINRA, they shall not be eligible to re-register as Foreign Associates.
  - (a) Persons registered as Order Processing Assistant Representatives shall be subject to the following conditions:
  - (1) Order Processing Assistant Representatives may not solicit transactions or new accounts on behalf of a member, render investment advice, make recommendations to customers regarding the appropriateness of securities transactions, effect transactions in securities markets on behalf of a member or accept customer orders for municipal securities and direct participation program securities as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(A) of this Rule;
  - (2) members may only compensate Order Processing Assistant Representatives on an hourly wage or salaried basis and may not in any way, directly or indirectly, relate their compensation to the number or size of transactions effected for customers, provided that Order Processing Assistant Representatives are not prohibited from receiving bonuses or other compensation based on a member's profit sharing plan or similar arrangement;
  - (3) the activities of Order Processing Assistant Representatives may only be conducted at a business location of a member that is under the direct supervision of an appropriately registered principal of the member; and
