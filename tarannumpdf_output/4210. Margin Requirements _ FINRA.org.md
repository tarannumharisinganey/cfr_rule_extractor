When the same security is carried "long" and "short" the margin to be maintained on such positions shall be 5 percent of the current market value of the "long" securities. In determining such margin requirements "short" positions shall be marked to the market.

## (2) Exempted Securities, Non-equity Securities and Baskets

(A) Obligations of the United States and Highly Rated Foreign Sovereign Debt Securities

On net "long" or net "short" positions in obligations (including zero coupon bonds, i.e., bonds with coupons detached or noninterest bearing bonds) issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States Government or by corporations in which the United States has a direct or indirect interest as shall be designated for exemption by the Secretary of the Treasury, or in obligations that are highly rated foreign sovereign debt securities, the margin to be maintained shall be the percentage of the current market value of such obligations as specified in the applicable category below:

| (i)   | Less than one year to maturity                   | 1 percent |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| (ii)  | One year but less than three years to maturity   | 2 percent |

Notwithstanding the above, on zero coupon bonds with five years or more to maturity the margin to be maintained shall not be less than 3 percent of the principal amount of the obligation.

When such obligations other than United States Treasury bills are due to mature in 30 calendar days or less, a member, at its discretion, may permit the customer to substitute another such obligation for the maturing obligation and use the margin held on the maturing obligation to reduce the margin required on the new obligation, provided the customer has given the member irrevocable instructions to redeem the maturing obligation.

## (B) All Other Exempted Securities

On any "long" or "short" positions in exempted securities other than obligations of the United States, the margin to be maintained shall be 7 percent of the current market value.

On any "long" or "short" positions in non-equity securities, the margin to be maintained (except where a lesser requirement is imposed by other provisions of this Rule) shall be:

- (i) 10 percent of the current market value in the case of investment grade debt securities; and
- (ii) 20 percent of the current market value or 7 percent of the principal amount, whichever amount is greater, in the case of all other listed non-equity securities, and all other margin eligible non-equity securities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this Rule.

#### (D) Baskets

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Rule, a member may clear and carry basket transactions of one or more members registered as market makers (who are deemed specialists for purposes of Section 7 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the rules of a national securities exchange) upon a margin basis satisfactory to the concerned parties, provided all real and potential risks in accounts carried under such arrangements are at all times adequately covered by the margin maintained in the account or, in the absence thereof, by the carrying member when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

#### (E) Special Provisions

Notwithstanding the foregoing in this paragraph (e)(2):

- (i) A member may, at its discretion, permit the use of accrued interest as an offset to the maintenance margin required to be maintained; and
  - (ii) FINRA, upon written application, may permit lower margin requirements on a case-by-case basis.

#### (F) Transactions with Exempt Accounts Involving Certain "Good Faith" Securities

Other than for Covered Agency Transactions as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(H) of this Rule, on any "long" or "short" position resulting from a transaction involving exempted securities, mortgage related securities, or major foreign sovereign debt securities made for or with an "exempt account," no margin need be required and any marked to the market loss on such position need not be collected. However, the amount of any uncollected marked to the market loss shall be deducted in computing the member's net capital as provided in SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), subject to the limits provided in paragraph (e)(2)(I) of this Rule.

Members shall maintain a written risk analysis methodology for assessing the amount of credit extended to exempt accounts pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(F) of this Rule which shall be made available to FINRA upon request. The risk limit determination shall be made by a designated credit risk officer or credit risk committee in accordance with the member's written risk policies and procedures.

# (G) Transactions With Exempt Accounts Involving Highly Rated Foreign Sovereign Debt Securities and Investment Grade Debt Securities

On any "long" or "short" position resulting from a transaction made for or with an "exempt account" (other than a position subject to paragraph (e)(2)(F) or (e)(2)(H) of this Rule), the margin to be maintained on highly rated foreign sovereign debt and investment grade debt securities shall be, in lieu of any greater requirements imposed under this Rule, (i) 0.5 percent of current market value in the case of highly rated foreign sovereign debt securities, and (ii) 3 percent of current market value in the case of all other investment grade debt securities. The member need not collect any such margin, provided the amount equal to the margin required shall be deducted in computing the member's net capital as provided in SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), subject to the limits provided in paragraph (e)(2)(I) of this Rule.

Members shall maintain a written risk analysis methodology for assessing the amount of credit extended to exempt accounts pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(G) of this Rule which shall be made available to FINRA upon request. The risk limit determination shall be made by a designated credit risk officer or credit risk committee in accordance with the member's written risk policies and procedures.

  - 4. the member shall submit to FINRA such information regarding its unmargined net mark to market losses, nonmargin counterparties and related capital charges, in such form and manner, as FINRA shall prescribe by Regulatory Notice or similar communication.

## (I) Limits on Net Capital Deductions

In the event that:

- (i) the net capital deductions taken by a member as a result of marked to the market losses incurred under paragraphs (e)(2) (F), (e)(2)(G) (exclusive of the percentage requirements established thereunder), or (e)(2)(H)(ii)d.1. of this Rule, plus any unmargined net mark to market losses below \$250,000 or of small cash counterparties exceed:
  - a. for any one account or group of commonly controlled accounts, 5 percent of the member's tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1), or
  - b. for all accounts combined, 25 percent of the member's tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1); and
- (ii) such excess as calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(I)(i) of this Rule continues to exist on the fifth business day after it was incurred;

the member shall give prompt written notice to FINRA and shall not enter into any new transaction(s) subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(F), (e)(2)(G) or (e)(2)(H) of this Rule that would result in an increase in the amount of such excess.

# (3) Joint Accounts in Which the Carrying Member or a Partner or Stockholder Therein Has an Interest

In the case of a joint account carried by a member in which such member, or any partner, or stockholder (other than a holder of freely transferable stock only) of such member participates with others, each participant other than the carrying member shall maintain an equity with respect to such interest pursuant to the margin provisions of this paragraph as if such interest were in a separate account.

Pursuant to the Rule 9600 Series, FINRA may grant an exemption from the provisions of this paragraph (e)(3), if the account is confined exclusively to transactions and positions in exempted securities.

In the case of an account conforming to the conditions described in this paragraph (e)(3), the exemption application shall also include the following information as of the date of the request:

- (A) complete description of the security;
- (B) cost price, offering price and principal amount of obligations which have been purchased or may be required to be purchased;
- (C) date on which the security is to be purchased or on which there will be a contingent commitment to purchase the security;
- (D) approximate aggregate indebtedness;
- (E) approximate net capital; and
- (F) approximate total market value of all readily marketable securities (i) exempted and (ii) non-exempted, held in member accounts, partners' capital accounts, partners' individual accounts covered by approved agreements providing for their inclusion as partnership property, accounts covered by subordination agreements approved by FINRA and customers' accounts in deficit.

## (4) International Arbitrage Accounts

International arbitrage accounts for non-member foreign brokers or dealers who are members of a foreign securities exchange shall not be subject to this Rule. The amount of any deficiency between the equity in such an account and the margin required by the other provisions of this Rule shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

#### (5) Specialists' and Market Makers' Accounts

(A) A member may carry the account of an "approved specialist" or "approved market maker," which account is limited to specialist or market making transactions, upon a margin basis which is satisfactory to both parties. The amount of any deficiency between the equity in the account and the haircut requirements pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 4110(a). However, when computing charges against net capital for transactions in securities covered by paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of this Rule, absent a greater haircut requirement that may have been imposed on such securities pursuant to Rule 4110(a), the respective requirements of those paragraphs may be used, rather than the haircut requirements of SEA Rule 15c3-1.

For the purpose of this paragraph (e)(5)(A), the term "approved specialist" or "approved market maker" means either:

- (i) a specialist or market maker, who is deemed a specialist for all purposes under the Exchange Act and who is registered pursuant to the rules of a national securities exchange; or
  - (ii) an OTC market maker or third market maker, who meets the requirements of Section 220.7(g)(5) of Regulation T.

(B) In the case of a joint account carried by a member in accordance with subparagraph (i) above in which the member participates, the equity maintained in the account by the other participants may be in any amount which is mutually satisfactory. The amount of any deficiency between the equity maintained in the account by the other participants and their proportionate share of the haircut requirements pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 4110(a). However, when computing charges against net capital for transactions in securities covered by paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of this Rule, absent a greater haircut requirement that may have been imposed on such securities pursuant to Rule 4110(a), the respective requirements of those paragraphs may be used, rather than the haircut requirements of SEA Rule 15c3-1.

#### (6) Broker-Dealer Accounts

(A) A member may carry the proprietary account of another broker-dealer, which is registered with the SEC, upon a margin basis which is satisfactory to both parties, provided the requirements of Regulation T and Rules 400 through 406 of SEC Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures and Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the CEA are adhered to and the account is not carried in a deficit equity condition. The amount of any deficiency between the equity maintained in the account and the haircut requirements pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 4110(a). However, when computing charges against net capital for transactions in securities covered by paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of this Rule, absent a greater haircut requirement that may have been imposed on such securities pursuant to Rule 4110(a), the respective requirements of those paragraphs may be used, rather than the haircut requirements of SEA Rule 15c3-1.

# (B) Joint Back Office Arrangements

An arrangement may be established between two or more registered broker-dealers pursuant to Regulation T Section 220.7, to form a joint back office ("JBO") arrangement for carrying and clearing or carrying accounts of participating broker-dealers. Members must provide written notification to FINRA prior to establishing a JBO arrangement.

- (i) A carrying and clearing, or carrying member must:
- a. maintain a minimum tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1) of \$25 million as computed pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), except that a member whose primary business consists of the clearance of options market-maker accounts may carry JBO accounts provided that it maintains a minimum net capital of \$7 million as computed pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a). In addition, the member must include in its ratio of gross options market maker deductions to net capital required by the provisions of SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), gross deductions for JBO participant accounts. Clearance of option market maker accounts shall be deemed a broker-dealer's primary business if a minimum of 60 percent of the aggregate deductions in the above ratio are options market maker deductions. In the event that a carrying and clearing, or a carrying member's tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1), or net capital, respectively, has fallen below the above requirements, the firm shall: 1. promptly notify FINRA in writing of such deficiency, 2. take appropriate action to resolve such deficiency within three consecutive business days, or not permit any new transactions to be entered into pursuant to the JBO arrangement;
- b. maintain a written risk analysis methodology for assessing the amount of credit extended to participating brokerdealers which shall be made available to FINRA on request; and
- c. deduct from net capital haircut requirements pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), amounts in excess of the equity maintained in the accounts of participating broker-dealers. However, when computing charges against net capital for transactions in securities covered by paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of this Rule, absent a greater haircut requirement that may have been imposed on such securities pursuant to Rule 4110(a), the respective requirements of those paragraphs may be used, rather than the haircut requirements of SEA Rule 15c3-1.
- (ii) A participating broker-dealer must:
  - a. be a registered broker-dealer subject to the SEC's net capital requirements and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a);
- b. maintain an ownership interest in the carrying/clearing member pursuant to Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, Section 220.7; and
- c. maintain a minimum liquidating equity of \$1 million in the JBO arrangement exclusive of the ownership interest established in subparagraph (ii)b. above. When the minimum liquidating equity decreases below the \$1 million requirement, the participant must deposit a sufficient amount to eliminate this deficiency within 5 business days or be subject to margin account requirements prescribed for customers in Regulation T, and the margin requirements pursuant to the other provisions of this Rule.

#### (7) Nonpurpose Credit

In a nonsecurities credit account, a member may extend and maintain nonpurpose credit to or for any customer without collateral or on any collateral whatever, provided:

- (A) the account is recorded separately and confined to the transactions and relations specifically authorized by Regulation T;
- (B) the account is not used in any way for the purpose of evading or circumventing any regulation of FINRA or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Rules 400 through 406 of SEC Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures and Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the CEA; and
- (C) the amount of any deficiency between the equity in the account and the margin required by the other provisions of this Rule shall be charged against the member's net capital as provided in SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

The term "nonpurpose credit" means an extension of credit other than "purpose credit" as defined in Section 220.2 of Regulation T.

## (8) Shelf-Registered and Other Control and Restricted Securities

- (A) Shelf-Registered Securities The equity to be maintained in margin accounts of customers for securities which are the subject of a current and effective registration for a continuous or delayed offering (shelf-registered securities) shall be at least the amount of margin required by paragraph (c) of this Rule, provided the member:
  - (i) obtains a current prospectus in effect with the SEC, meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act, covering such securities;
  - (ii) has no reason to believe the Registration Statement is not in effect or that the issuer has been delinquent in filing such periodic reports as may be required of it with the SEC and is satisfied that such registration will be kept in effect and that the prospectus will be maintained on a current basis; and
    - (iii) retains a copy of such Registration Statement, including the prospectus, in an easily accessible place in its files.

Shelf-registered securities which do not meet all the conditions prescribed above shall have no value for purposes of this Rule. Also see subparagraph (C) below.

- (B) Other Control and Restricted Securities Except as provided in subparagraph (D) below, the equity in accounts of customers for other control and restricted securities of issuers that are subject to Securities Act Rule 144 or 145(c), shall be 40 percent of the current market value of such securities "long" in the account, provided the member:
  - (i) in computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), deducts any margin deficiencies in customers' accounts based upon a margin requirement as specified in subparagraph (C)(iv) below for such securities and values only that amount of such securities which are then saleable under Securities Act Rule 144(b)(2) or 145(d)(2)(i) in conformity with all of the applicable terms and conditions thereof, for purposes of determining such deficiencies; and
  - (ii) makes volume computations necessary to determine the amount of securities then saleable under Securities Act Rule 144(b)(2) or 145(d)(2)(i) on a weekly basis or at such frequency as the member and/or FINRA may deem appropriate under the circumstances. See also subparagraph (C) below.

- (C) Additional Requirements on Shelf-Registered Securities and Other Control and Restricted Securities Except as provided in subparagraph (D) below, a member extending credit on shelf-registered and other control and restricted securities in margin accounts of customers shall be subject to the following additional requirements:
  - (i) FINRA may at any time require reports from members showing relevant information as to the amount of credit extended on shelf-registered, and other control and restricted securities and the amount, if any, deducted from net capital due to such security positions.
  - (ii) The greater of the aggregate credit agreed to be extended in writing or the aggregate credit that is actually extended to all customers on control and restricted securities of any one issue that exceeds 10 percent of the member's excess net capital shall be deducted from net capital for purposes of determining a member's status under Rule 4120. The amount of such aggregate credit extended, which has been deducted in computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), need not be included in this calculation. FINRA, upon written application, may reduce the deduction to net capital under Rule 4120 to 25 percent of such aggregate credit extended that exceeds 10 percent but is less than 15 percent of the member's excess net capital.
  - (iii) The aggregate credit extended to all customers on all control and restricted securities (reduced by the amount of such aggregate credit which has been deducted in computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a)), shall be deducted from net capital on the following basis for purposes of determining a member's status under Rule 4120.
    - a. To the extent such net amount of credit extended does not exceed 50 percent of a member's excess net capital, 25 percent of such net amount of credit extended shall be deducted, and
    - b. 100 percent of such net amount of credit extended which exceeds 50 percent of a member's excess net capital shall be deducted.
  - (iv) Concentration Reduction. A concentration exists whenever the aggregate position in control and restricted securities of any one issue, excluding excess securities (as defined below), exceeds:
    - a. 10 percent of the outstanding shares of such issue, or
    - b. 100 percent of the average weekly volume for such issue during the preceding three-month period.

Where a concentration exists, for purposes of computing subparagraph (B)(i) above, the margin requirement on such securities shall be, based on the greater of subparagraph (iv)a. or b., above, as specified below:

| Percent of Outstanding Shares        | or Percent of Average Weekly Volume    | Margin<br>Requirement |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Up to 10 percent                     | Up to 100 percent                      | 25 percent            |
| Over 10 percent and under 15 percent | Over 100 percent and under 200 percent | 30 percent            |
| 15 percent and under 20 percent      | 200 percent and under 300 percent      | 45 percent            |
| 20 percent and under 25 percent      | 300 percent and under 400 percent      | 60 percent            |
| 25 percent and under 30 percent      | 400 percent and under 500 percent      | 75 percent            |
| 30 percent and above                 | 500 percent and above                  | 100 percent           |

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(8)(C)(iv), "excess securities" shall mean the amount of securities, if any, by which the aggregate position in control and restricted securities of any one issue exceeds the aggregate amount of securities that would be required to support the aggregate credit extended on such control and restricted securities if the applicable margin requirement were 50 percent.

(v) The amount to be deducted from net capital for purposes of determining a member's status under Rule 4120, pursuant to paragraph (e)(8)(C) shall not exceed 100 percent of the aggregate credit extended reduced by any amount deducted in computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

- (D) Certain Restricted Securities Securities either:
  - (i) then saleable pursuant to the terms and conditions of Securities Act Rule 144(b)(1), or
- (ii) then saleable pursuant to the terms and conditions of Securities Act Rule 145(d)(2), shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (e)(8) of this Rule.

# (9) Security-Based Swaps; SBS Offsets

Except for SBS carried by a member in a portfolio margin account subject to the requirements of Rule 4210(g), margin requirements on SBS and positions in Uncleared SBS Accounts are determined by Rule 4240, rather than Rule 4210. When one or more securities or options positions in a customer's margin account are included in a combination of SBS, securities or options positions on which an Initial Margin Requirement is computed under paragraph (b)(2)(A)(i) or (b)(2)(A)(ii) of Rule 4240, and the Initial Margin Requirement computed on the combination is less than the aggregate margin requirement on such securities or options positions under other provisions of this Rule, the aggregate margin requirement on such margin account positions shall be reduced to the Initial Margin Requirement computed on the combination. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(9), the terms "SBS," "Uncleared SBS Account," and "Initial Margin Requirement" have the meanings given them in Rule 4240.

## (f) Other Provisions

## (1) Determination of Value for Margin Purposes

Active securities dealt in on a national securities exchange shall, for margin purposes, be valued at current market prices provided that only those options contracts on a stock or stock index, or a stock index warrant, having an expiration that exceeds nine months and that are listed or OTC (as defined in this Rule), may be deemed to have market value for the purposes of this Rule. Other securities shall be valued conservatively in view of current market prices and the amount that might be realized upon liquidation. Substantial additional margin must be required in all cases where the securities carried in "long" or "short" positions are subject to unusually rapid or violent changes in value, or do not have an active market on a national securities exchange, or where the amount carried is such that the position(s) cannot be liquidated promptly.

If the option or warrant contract provides for the delivery of obligations with different maturity dates or coupon rates, the computation of the "out-of-the-money amount," if any, where required by this Rule, shall be made in such a manner as to result in the highest margin requirement on the short option or warrant position.

- (ii) In the case of listed puts and calls which represent options on GNMA obligations in the principal amount of \$100,000, 130 percent of the current market value of the option plus \$1,500, except that the margin required need not exceed \$5,000 plus the current market value of the option.
- (iii) In the case of OTC puts and calls, the percentage of the current value of the underlying component and the applicable multiplier, if any, specified in column II below, plus any "in-the-money amount" (as defined in this paragraph (f)(2)(E)(iii)).

In the case of OTC options, the margin on any put or call carried "short" in a customer's account may be reduced by any "out-of-the-money amount" (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(E)(i)), but shall not be less than the percentage of the current value of the underlying component and the applicable multiplier, if any, specified in column III below, except in the case of any OTC put carried "short" in a customer's account. Margin on such put option contracts shall not be less than the percentage of the put option's exercise price as specified in column III below.

<sup>\*</sup> Option contracts under category (4) must be for a principal amount of not less than \$500,000.

For the purpose of this paragraph (f)(2)(E)(iii), "in-the-money amounts" are determined as follows:

- (iv) OTC puts and calls representing options on U.S. Government and U.S. Government Agency debt securities that qualify for exemption pursuant to SEA Rule 3a12-7, must be for a principal amount of not less than \$500,000, and shall be subject to the following requirements:
  - a. For exempt accounts, as defined in paragraph (a)(13), 3 percent of the current value of the underlying principal amount on thirty (30) year U.S. Treasury bonds and non-mortgage backed U.S. Government agency debt securities; and 2 percent of the current value of the underlying principal amount on all other U.S. Government and U.S. Government agency debt securities, plus any "in-the-money amount" (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(E)(iii)) or minus any "out-of-the-money amount" (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(E)(i)). The amount of any deficiency between the equity in the account and the margin required shall be deducted in computing the net capital of the member under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), on the following basis:
    - 1. On any one account or group of commonly controlled accounts to the extent such deficiency exceeds 5 percent of a member's tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1), 100 percent of such excess amount, and
    - 2. On all accounts combined to the extent such deficiency exceeds 25 percent of a member's tentative net capital (as such term is defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1), 100 percent of such excess amount, reduced by any amount already deducted pursuant to subparagraph (a) above.
  - b. For non-exempt accounts, 5 percent of the current value of the underlying principal amount on thirty (30) year U.S. Treasury bonds and non-mortgage backed U.S. Government agency debt securities; and 3 percent of the current value of the underlying principal amount on all other U.S. Government and U.S. Government agency debt securities, plus any "in-themoney amount" or minus any "out-of-the-money amount," provided the minimum margin shall not be less than 1 percent of the current value of the underlying principal amount.
- (F)(i) Each put or call shall be margined separately and any difference between the current market value of the underlying component and the exercise price of a put or call shall be considered to be of value only in providing the amount of margin required on that particular put or call. Substantial additional margin must be required on listed or OTC options carried "short" with an unusually long period of time to expiration, or written on securities which are subject to unusually rapid or violent changes in value, or which do not have an active market, or where the securities subject to the option cannot be liquidated promptly.
  - (ii) No margin need be required on any "covered" put or call.

(G)(i) Where both a listed put and call specify the same underlying component and are carried "short" for a customer, the amount of margin required shall be the margin on the put or call, whichever is greater, as required pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(E) (i) above, plus the current market value on the other option.

## When:

- a. a currency call warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" currency put warrant and/or currency put option position;
- b. a currency put warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" currency call warrant and/or currency put option position;
- c. a currency index call warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" currency index put warrant and/or currency put option position;
- d. a currency index put warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" currency index call warrant and/or currency index call option position;
- e. a stock index call warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" stock index put warrant and/or stock index put option position;
- f. a stock index put warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" stock index call warrant and/or stock index call option position;
- g. an index call warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" index put warrant and/or index put option position;
- h. an index put warrant position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" index call warrant and/or index call option position;
- i. a broad index stock group call option position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" broad index stock group put option position; or
- j. a broad index stock group put option position is carried "short" for a customer account and is offset by a "short" broad index stock group call option position and the offset position is of equivalent underlying value on the same currency, currency index or index stock group, as appropriate,

then the amount of margin required shall be the margin on the put position or the call position, whichever is greater, as required pursuant to subparagraph (E)(i), plus the current market value of the other warrant and/or option position.

- (ii) Where either or both the put and call specifying the same underlying component are not listed and are OTC and carried "short" for a customer by the same carrying broker-dealer (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(H) below), the amount of margin required shall be the margin on the put or call, whichever is greater, as required pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2)(E)(iii) and (E)(iv) above, plus any unrealized loss on the other option. Where either or both the put or call are not listed or OTC and are carried by the same carrying broker-dealer then the put and call must be margined separately pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2)(E)(iii) and (E)(iv) above, however, the minimum margin shall not apply to the other option.
- (iii) If both a put and call for the same GNMA obligation in the principal amount of \$100,000 are listed or OTC and are carried "short" for a customer, the amount of margin required shall be the margin on the put or call, whichever is greater, as required pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(E)(ii) above, plus the current market value of the other option.

(H)(i) For spreads as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A)(xxxii) of this Rule, the margin required on the "short" options shall be the lesser of:

- a. The margin required pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(E); or
- b. The maximum potential loss. The maximum potential loss is determined by computing the intrinsic value of the options at price points for the underlying security or instrument that are set to correspond to every exercise price present in the spread. The intrinsic values are netted at each price point. The maximum potential loss is the greatest loss, if any.

"Long" options must be paid for in full. The proceeds of the "short" options may be applied towards the cost of the "long" options and/or any margin requirement.

(ii) Where a call warrant issued on an underlying currency, index currency group or index stock group is carried "long" for a customer's account and the account is also "short" a listed call option, or index stock group, which "short" call position(s) expire on or before the date of expiration of the "long" call position and specify the same number of units of the same underlying currency or the same index multiplier for the same index currency group or index stock group, as the case may be, the margin required on the "short" call(s) shall be the requirement pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(H)(i) above.

Where a put warrant issued on an underlying currency, index currency group or index stock group is carried "long" for a customer's account and the account is also "short" a listed put option, and/or a put warrant, on the same underlying currency, index currency group, or index stock group, which "short" put position(s) expire on or before the date of expiration of the "long" put position and specify the same number of units of the same underlying currency or the same index multiplier for the same index currency group or index stock group, as the case may be, the margin required on the "short" put(s) shall be the requirement pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(H)(i) above.

- (iii)a. For spreads as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A)(xxxii) of this Rule, that are written on the same GNMA obligation in the principal amount of \$100,000, the margin required on the "short" options shall be the lower of:
  - 1. the margin required pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(E)(ii) above; or
  - 2. the maximum potential loss, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(H)(i)b. of this Rule, multiplied by the appropriate multiplier factor set forth below.

"Long" options must be paid for in full. The proceeds of the "short" options may be applied towards the cost of the "long" options and/or any margin requirement.

b. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(H)(iii) the multiplier factor to be applied shall depend on the then current highest qualifying rate as defined by the rules of the national securities exchange on or through which the option is listed or traded. If the then current highest qualifying rate is less than 8 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1; if the then current highest qualifying rate is greater than or equal to 8 percent but less than 10 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1.2; if the then current highest qualifying rate is greater than or equal to 10 percent but less than 12 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1.4; if the then current highest qualifying rate is greater than or equal to 12 percent but less than 14 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1.5; if the then current highest qualifying rate is greater than or equal to 14 percent but less than 16 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1.6; and if the then current highest qualifying rate is greater than or equal to 16 percent but less than or equal to 18 percent, the multiplier factor shall be 1.7. The multiplier factor or factors for higher qualifying rates shall be established by FINRA as required.

(iv) The "long" and "short" OTC option contracts that comprise a spread as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A)(xxxii) must be issued and guaranteed by the same carrying broker-dealer and the carrying broker-dealer must also be a FINRA member. If the "long" and "short" OTC option contracts are not issued and guaranteed by the same carrying broker-dealer, or if the carrying broker-dealer is not a FINRA member, then the "short" option contracts must be margined separately pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) (E)(iii) or (E)(iv) above.

- (v) The following requirements set forth the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained in margin accounts of customers having positions in components underlying options, and stock index warrants, when such components are held in conjunction with certain positions in the overlying option or warrant. The option or warrant must be listed or OTC (as defined in this Rule). In the case of a call or warrant carried in a short position, a related long position in the underlying component shall be valued at no more than the call/warrant exercise price for margin equity purposes.
  - a. "Long" Option or Warrant Offset. When a component underlying an option or warrant is carried "long" ("short") in the same account as a "long" put (call) or warrant specifying equivalent units of the underlying component, the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained on the underlying component is 10 percent of the aggregate option/warrant exercise price plus the "out-of-the-money" amount, not to exceed the minimum maintenance required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Rule.
  - b. Conversions. When a call or warrant carried in a "short" position is covered by a "long" position in equivalent units of the underlying component and there is carried in the same account a "long" put or warrant specifying equivalent units of the same underlying component and having the same exercise price and expiration date as the short call or warrant, the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained for the underlying component shall be 10 percent of the aggregate exercise price.
  - c. Reverse Conversions. When a put or warrant carried in a "short" position is covered by a "short" position in equivalent units of the underlying component and there is carried in the same account a "long" call or warrant specifying equivalent units of the same underlying component and having the same exercise price and expiration date as the "short" put or warrant, the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained for the underlying component shall be 10 percent of the aggregate exercise price plus the amount by which the exercise price of the put exceeds the current market value of the underlying, if any.
  - d. Collars. When a call or warrant carried in a "short" position is covered by a "long" position in equivalent units of the underlying component and there is carried in the same account a "long" put or warrant specifying equivalent units of the same underlying component and having a lower exercise price and the same expiration date as the "short" call/warrant, the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained for the underlying component shall be the lesser of 10 percent of the aggregate exercise price of the put plus the put "out-of-the-money" amount or 25 percent of the call aggregate exercise price.
  - e. "Long" Box Spread in European-Style Options. With respect to a "long" box spread as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A) of this Rule, in which all component options have a European-style exercise provision and are listed or OTC (as defined in this Rule), margin must be deposited and maintained equal to at least 50 percent of the aggregate difference in the exercise prices. The net proceeds from the sale of "short" option components may be applied to the requirement. For margin purposes, the "long" box spread may be valued at an amount not to exceed 100 percent of the aggregate difference in the exercise prices.
  - f. Protected Options. When an index call (put) option or warrant is carried "short" (the "protected option or warrant position") and there is carried in the same account a long (short) position in an underlying stock basket, non-leveraged index mutual fund or non-leveraged exchange-traded fund (each, the "protection") that is based on the same index underlying the index option or warrant, the protected option or warrant position is not subject to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(2)(E)(i) and (f)(2)(E)(iii) of this Rule if the following conditions are met:
    - 1. when the protected option or warrant position is created, the absolute value of the protection is not less than 100 percent of the aggregate current underlying index value associated with the protected option or warrant position determined at either:
      - A. the time the order that created the protected option or warrant position was entered or executed; or
      - B. the close of business on the trading day the protected option or warrant position was created;
    - 2. the absolute value of the protection is at no time less than 95 percent of the aggregate current underlying index value associated with the protected option or warrant position; and
      - 3. margin is maintained in an amount equal to the greater of:
      - A. the amount, if any, by which the aggregate current underlying index value is above (below) the aggregate exercise price of the protected call (put) option or warrant position; or
      - B. the amount, if any, by which the absolute value of the protection is below 100 percent of the aggregate current underlying index value associated with the protected option or warrant.

- (I)(i) Where a listed or OTC call is carried "short" against an existing net "long" position in the security underlying the option or in any security immediately exchangeable or convertible, other than warrants, without restriction including the payment of money into the security underlying the option, no margin need be required on the call, provided:
  - a. such net "long" position is adequately margined in accordance with this Rule; and
  - b. the right to exchange or convert the net "long" position does not expire on or before the date of expiration of the "short" call. Where a listed or OTC put is carried "short" against an existing net "short" position in the security underlying the option, no margin need be required on the put, provided such net "short" position is adequately margined in accordance with this Rule.
- (ii) Where a listed or OTC call is carried "short" against an existing net "long" position in a warrant convertible into the security underlying the option, margin shall be required on the call equal to any amount by which the conversion price of the "long" warrant exceeds the exercise price of the call, provided:
  - a. such net "long" position is adequately margined in accordance with this Rule; and
  - b. the right to convert the net "long" position does not expire on or before the date of expiration of the "short" call. However, when a payment of money is required to convert the "long" warrant such warrant shall have no value for purposes of this Rule.
- (iii) In determining net "long" and net "short" positions, for purposes of paragraphs (f)(2)(I)(i) and (ii) above, offsetting "long" and "short" positions in exchangeable or convertible securities (including warrants) or in the same security, as discussed in paragraph (e)(1), shall be deducted. In computing margin on such an existing net security position carried against a put or call, the current market price to be used shall not be greater than the exercise price in the case of a call or less than the current market price in the case of a put and the required margin shall be increased by any unrealized loss.
- (iv) Where a listed or OTC put or call option or stock index warrant is carried "short" in the account of a customer, against an escrow agreement, that is in a form satisfactory to FINRA, is issued by a third party custodian bank or trust company (the "custodian"), either is held in the account at the time the put or call is written, or is received in the account promptly thereafter, and is in compliance with the requirements of Rule 610 of The Options Clearing Corporation, no margin need be required on the put or call.

In the case of a call option or warrant on a broad index stock group, the escrow agreement must certify that the custodian holds for the account of the customer as security for the agreement either cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified securities, or any combination thereof, having an aggregate market value, computed as at the close of business on the day the call is written, of not less than 100 percent of the aggregate index value computed as at the same time and that the custodian will promptly pay the member the exercise settlement amount in the event the account is assigned an exercise notice. The escrow agreement may provide for substitution of qualified securities held as collateral provided that the substitution shall not cause the value of the qualified securities held to be diminished. A qualified security means an equity security, other than a warrant, right or option, that is registered on any national securities exchange.

In the case of a call on any other option contract, the escrow agreement must certify that the custodian holds for the account of the customer as security for the agreement, the underlying security (or a security immediately convertible into the underlying security without the payment of money) or foreign currency and that the custodian will promptly deliver to the member the underlying security or foreign currency in the event the account is assigned an exercise notice.

In the case of a put on an option contract (including a put on a broad index stock group) or stock index warrant, the escrow agreement must certify that the custodian holds for the account of the customer as security for the agreement, cash or cash equivalents which have an aggregate market value, computed as at the close of business on the day the put is written, of not less than 100 percent of the aggregate exercise price of the put and that the custodian will promptly pay the member the exercise settlement amount (in the case of a put on a broad index stock group) or the aggregate exercise price (in the case of any other put on an option contract) in the event the account is assigned an exercise notice. Cash equivalents shall mean those securities referred to in Section 220.2 of Regulation T.

(J) When a member guarantees an option or stock index warrant to receive or deliver securities or foreign currencies for a customer, such option or stock index warrant shall be margined as if it were a put or call.

(K)(i) Registered specialists, market makers or traders — Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph (f)(2), a member may clear and carry the listed option transactions of one or more registered specialists, registered market makers or registered traders in options (whereby registered traders are deemed specialists for all purposes under the Exchange Act, pursuant to the rules of a national securities exchange) (hereinafter referred to as "specialist(s)"), upon a "Good Faith" margin basis satisfactory to the concerned parties, provided the "Good Faith" margin requirement is not less than the net capital haircut deduction of the member carrying the transaction pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a). In lieu of collecting the "Good Faith" margin requirement, a carrying member may elect to deduct in computing its net capital the amount of any deficiency between the equity maintained in the account and the "Good Faith" margin required.

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(K), a permitted offset position means, in the case of an option in which a specialist or market maker makes a market, a position in the underlying asset or other related assets, and in the case of other securities in which a specialist or market maker makes a market, a position in options overlying the securities in which a specialist or market maker makes a market. Accordingly, a specialist or market maker in options may establish, on a share-for-share basis, a long or short position in the securities underlying the options in which the specialist or market maker makes a market, and a specialist or market maker in securities other than options may purchase or write options overlying the securities in which the specialist or market maker makes a market, if the account holds the following permitted offset positions:

- a. A "short" option position which is not offset by a "long" or "short" option position for an equal or greater number of shares of the same underlying security which is "in the money";
- b. A "long" option position which is not offset by a "long" or "short" option position for an equal or greater number of shares of the same underlying security which is "in the money";
  - c. A "short" option position against which an exercise notice was tendered;
  - d. A "long" option position which was exercised;
  - e. A net "long" position in a security (other than an option) in which a specialist or market maker makes a market;
  - f. A net "short" position in a security (other than an option) in which the specialist or market maker makes a market; or
- g. A specified portfolio type as referred to in SEA Rule 15c3-1, including its appendices, or any applicable SEC staff interpretation or no-action position.

Permitted offset transactions must be effected for specialist or market making purposes such as hedging, risk reduction, rebalancing of positions, liquidation, or accommodation of customer orders, or other similar specialist or market maker purpose. The specialist or market maker must be able to demonstrate compliance with this provision.

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(K), the term "in the money" means the current market price of the underlying asset or index is not below (with respect to a call option) or above (with respect to a put option) the exercise price of the option; and, the term "overlying option" means a put option purchased or a call option written against a "long" position in an underlying asset; or a call option purchased or a put option written against a "short" position in an underlying asset.

- (ii) Securities, including options, in such accounts shall be valued conservatively in the light of current market prices and the amount which might be realized upon liquidation. Substantial additional margin must be required or excess net capital maintained in all cases where the securities carried:
  - a. are subject to unusually rapid or violent changes in value including volatility in the expiration months of options;
  - b. do not have an active market; or
  - c. in one or more or all accounts, including proprietary accounts combined, are such that they cannot be liquidated promptly or represent undue concentration of risk in view of the carrying member's net capital and its overall exposure to material loss.
- (L) FINRA may at any time impose higher margin requirements with respect to any option or warrant position(s) when it deems such higher margin requirements are appropriate.
- (M) Exclusive designation A customer may designate at the time an option order is entered which security position held in the account is to serve in lieu of the required margin, if such service is offered by the member; or the customer may have a standing agreement with the member as to the method to be used for determining on any given day which security position will be used in lieu of the margin to support an option transaction. Any security held in the account which serves in lieu of the required margin for a short put or short call shall be unavailable to support any other option transaction in the account.

- (N) Cash account transactions A member may make option transactions in a customer's cash account, provided that:
  - (i) The transaction is permissible under Regulation T, Section 220.8; or
- (ii) A spread, as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A)(xxxii) of this Rule, comprised of European-style cash-settled index stock group options, or a "short" stock index warrant and a "long" stock index warrant, having the same underlying component or index that is based on the same aggregate current underlying value, that is held in or purchased for the account on the same day, is deemed a covered position and eligible for the cash account provided that:
  - a. the "long" positions and the "short" positions expire concurrently;
  - b. the "long" positions are paid in full; and
  - c. there is held in the account at the time the positions are established, or received into the account promptly thereafter:
    - 1. cash or cash equivalents of not less than the maximum loss, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(H)(i)b. of this Rule, to which net proceeds from the sale of the "short" positions may be applied, or
      - 2. an escrow agreement.

The escrow agreement must certify that the bank holds for the account of the customer as security for the agreement i. cash, ii. cash equivalents, or iii. a combination thereof having an aggregate market value at the time the positions are established of not less than the maximum loss, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(H)(i)b. of this Rule and that the bank will promptly pay the member such amount in the event the account is assigned an exercise notice or that the bank will promptly pay the member sufficient funds to purchase a warrant sold "short" in the event of a buyin.

d. A "long" warrant may offset a "short" option contract and a "long" option contract may offset a "short" warrant provided that they have the same underlying component or index and equivalent aggregate current underlying value. In the event that the "long" position is not listed, it must be guaranteed by the carrying broker-dealer; otherwise the "short" position is not eligible for the cash account and must be margined separately pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(E).

#### (3) "When Issued" and "When Distributed" Securities

#### (A) Margin Accounts

The margin to be maintained on any transaction or net position in each "when issued" security shall be the same as if such security were issued.

Each position in a "when issued" security shall be margined separately and any unrealized profit shall be of value only in providing the amount of margin required on that particular position.

When an account has a "short" position in a "when issued" security and there are held in the account securities upon which the "when issued" security may be issued, such "short" position shall be marked to the market and the balance in the account shall for the purpose of this Rule be adjusted for any unrealized loss in such "short" position.

#### (B) Cash Accounts

On any transaction or net position resulting from contracts for a "when issued" security in an account other than that of a member, non-member broker-dealer, or a "designated account," equity must be maintained equal to the margin required were such transaction or position in a margin account.

On any net position resulting from contracts for a "when issued" security made for or with a non-member broker-dealer, no margin need be required, but such net position must be marked to the market.

On any net position resulting from contracts for a "when issued" security made for a member or a "designated account," no margin need be required and such net position need not be marked to the market. However, where such net position is not marked to the market, an amount equal to the loss at the market in such position shall be charged against the member's net capital as provided in SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

The provisions of this paragraph (f)(3) shall not apply to any position resulting from contracts on a "when issued" basis in a security:

- (i) which is the subject of a primary distribution in connection with a bona fide offering by the issuer to the general public for "cash," or
- (ii) which is exempt by FINRA as involving a primary distribution. The term "when issued" as used herein also means "when distributed."

# (4) Guaranteed Accounts

Any account guaranteed by another account may be consolidated with such other account and the margin to be maintained may be determined on the net position of both accounts, provided the guarantee is in writing and permits the member carrying the account, without restriction, to use the money and securities in the guaranteeing account to carry the guaranteed account or to pay any deficit therein; and provided further that such guaranteeing account is not owned directly or indirectly by (i) a member, or any stockholder (other than a holder of freely transferable stock only) in the member carrying such account, or (ii) a member, or any stockholder (other than a holder of freely transferable stock only) therein having a definite arrangement for participating in the commissions earned on the guaranteed account. However, the guarantee of a limited partner or of a holder of non-voting stock, if based upon his resources other than his capital contribution to or other than his interest in a member, is not affected by the foregoing prohibition, and such a guarantee may be taken into consideration in computing margin to be maintained in the guaranteed account.

When one or more accounts are guaranteed by another account and the total margin deficiencies guaranteed by any guarantor exceeds 10 percent of the member's excess net capital, the amount of the margin deficiency being guaranteed in excess of 10 percent of excess net capital shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

# (5) Consolidation of Accounts

When two or more accounts are carried for a customer, the margin to be maintained may be determined on the net position of said accounts, provided the customer has consented that the money and securities in each of such accounts may be used to carry or pay any deficit in all such accounts.

## (6) Time Within Which Margin or "Mark to Market" Must Be Obtained

The amount of margin or "mark to market" required by any provision of this Rule shall be obtained as promptly as possible and in any event within 15 business days from the date such deficiency occurred, unless FINRA has specifically granted the member additional time.

## (7) Practice of Meeting Regulation T Margin Calls by Liquidation Prohibited

When a "margin call," as defined in Section 220.2 of Regulation T, is required in a customer's account, no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of either deferring the deposit of cash or securities beyond the time when such transactions would ordinarily be settled or cleared, or meeting the margin required by the liquidation of the same or other commitments in the account.

This prohibition on liquidations shall not apply (i) to those accounts that, at the time of liquidation, are in compliance with the equity to be maintained pursuant to the provisions of this Rule or (ii) to any account carried on an omnibus basis as prescribed by Regulation T.

#### (8) Special Initial and Maintenance Margin Requirements

- (A) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Rule, FINRA may, whenever it shall determine that market conditions so warrant, prescribe:
  - (i) higher initial margin requirements for the purpose of effecting new securities transactions and commitments in accounts of customers with respect to specific securities;
    - (ii) higher maintenance margin requirements for accounts of customers with respect to any securities; and
  - (iii) such other terms and conditions as FINRA shall deem appropriate relating to initial and/or maintenance margin requirements for accounts of customers with respect to any securities.

## (B) Day Trading

- (i) The term "day trading" means the purchasing and selling or the selling and purchasing of the same security on the same day in a margin account except for:
  - a. a "long" security position held overnight and sold the next day prior to any new purchase of the same security, or
  - b. a "short" security position held overnight and purchased the next day prior to any new sale of the same security.
- (ii) The term "pattern day trader" means any customer who executes four or more day trades within five business days. However, if the number of day trades is 6 percent or less of total trades for the five business day period, the customer will not be considered a pattern day trader and the special requirements under paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iv) of this Rule will not apply. In the event that the member at which a customer seeks to open an account or to resume day trading knows or has a reasonable basis to believe that the customer will engage in pattern day trading, then the special requirements under paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iv) of this Rule will apply.
- (iii) The term "day-trading buying power" means the equity in a customer's account at the close of business of the previous day, less any maintenance margin requirement as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this Rule, multiplied by four for equity securities.

The day-trading buying power for non-equity securities may be computed using the applicable special maintenance margin requirements pursuant to other provisions of this Rule.

Whenever day trading occurs in a customer's margin account the special maintenance margin required, based on the cost of all the day trades made during the day, shall be 25 percent for margin eligible equity securities, and 100 percent for nonmargin eligible equity securities. For non-equity securities, the special maintenance margin shall be as required pursuant to the other provisions of this Rule. Alternatively, when two or more day trades occur on the same day in the same customer's account, the margin required may be computed utilizing the highest (dollar amount) open position during that day. To utilize the highest open position computation method, a record showing the "time and tick" of each trade must be maintained to document the sequence in which each day trade was completed.

When the equity in a customer's account, after giving consideration to the other provisions of this Rule, is not sufficient to meet the day trading requirements of this paragraph, additional cash or securities must be received into the account to meet any deficiency within five business days of the trade date.

- (iv) Special Requirements for Pattern Day Traders
- a. Minimum Equity Requirement for Pattern Day Traders The minimum equity required for the accounts of customers deemed to be pattern day traders shall be \$25,000. This minimum equity must be deposited in the account before such customer may continue day trading and must be maintained in the customer's account at all times.
- b. In the event that the member at which a customer seeks to open an account or resume day trading in an existing account, knows or has a reasonable basis to believe that the customer will engage in pattern day trading, then the minimum equity required under subparagraph (iv)a. above (\$25,000) must be deposited in the account prior to commencement of day trading.
- c. Pattern day traders cannot trade in excess of their day-trading buying power as defined in paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iii) above. In the event a pattern day trader exceeds its day-trading buying power, which creates a special maintenance margin deficiency, the following actions will be taken by the member:
  - 1. The account will be margined based on the cost of all the day trades made during the day,
  - 2. The customer's day-trading buying power will be limited to the equity in the customer's account at the close of business of the previous day, less the maintenance margin required in paragraph (c) of this Rule, multiplied by two for equity securities, and
  - 3. "time and tick" (i.e., calculating margin using each trade in the sequence that it is executed, using the highest open position during the day) may not be used.
- d. Pattern day traders who fail to meet their special maintenance margin calls as required within five business days from the date the margin deficiency occurs will be permitted to execute transactions only on a cash available basis for 90 days or until the special maintenance margin call is met.
- e. Pattern day traders are restricted from using the guaranteed account provision pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this Rule for meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(8)(B).
- f. Funds deposited into a pattern day trader's account to meet the minimum equity or maintenance margin requirements of paragraph (f)(8)(B) of this Rule cannot be withdrawn for a minimum of two business days following the close of business on the day of deposit.
- (v) In the event a customer does not meet a special margin maintenance call by the fifth business day, then on the sixth business day only, members are required to deduct from net capital the amount of the unmet special margin maintenance call pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a).

## (9) Free-Riding in Cash Accounts Prohibited

No member shall permit a customer (other than a broker-dealer) to make a practice, directly or indirectly, of effecting transactions in a cash account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities. No member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker-dealer where such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for. A member transferring an account which is subject to a Regulation T 90-day freeze to another member shall inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze.

The provisions of Section 220.8(c) of Regulation T dictate the prohibitions and exceptions against customers' free-riding. Members may apply to FINRA in writing for waiver of a 90-day freeze not exempted by Regulation T.

## (10) Customer Margin Rules Relating to Security Futures

#### (A) Applicability

No member may effect a transaction involving, or carry an account containing, a security futures contract with or for a customer in a margin account, without obtaining proper and adequate margin as set forth in this subparagraph.

## (B) Amount of customer margin

- (i) General Rule. As set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Rule, the minimum initial and maintenance margin levels for each security futures contract, long and short, shall be 20 percent of the current market value of such contract.
- (ii) Excluded from the Rule's requirements are arrangements between a member and a customer with respect to the customer's financing of proprietary positions in security futures, based on the member's good faith determination that the customer is an "Exempted Person," as defined in Rule 401(a)(9) of SEC Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures, and Rule 41.43(a)(9) under the CEA, except for the proprietary account of a broker-dealer carried by a member pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(A) of this Rule. Once a registered broker or dealer, or member of a national securities exchange ceases to qualify as an "Exempted Person," it shall notify the member of this fact before establishing any new security futures positions. Any new security futures positions will be subject to the provisions of this subparagraph.

Accordingly, a security futures dealer may establish a long or short position in the assets underlying the security futures contracts in which the security futures dealer makes a market, and may purchase or write options overlying those assets if the account holds the following permitted offset positions:
  - a. A "long" position in the security futures contract or underlying asset offset by a "short" option position that is "in or at the money";
  - b. A "short" position in the security futures contract or underlying asset offset by a "long" option position that is "in or at the money";
  - c. A position in the underlying asset resulting from the assignment of a market-maker "short" option position or making delivery in respect of a short security futures contract;

#### (E) Approved Options Specialists' or Approved Market Makers' Accounts

- (i) Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(2)(K), a member may carry and clear the market maker permitted offset positions (as defined below) of one or more approved options specialists or approved market makers in an account that is limited to bona fide approved options specialist or approved market maker transactions, upon a "Good Faith" margin basis that is satisfactory to the concerned parties, provided the "Good Faith" margin requirement is not less than the net capital haircut deduction of the member carrying the transaction pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a). In lieu of collecting the "Good Faith" margin requirement, a carrying member may elect to deduct in computing its net capital the amount of any deficiency between the equity maintained in the account and the "Good Faith" margin required. For the purpose of this paragraph (f)(10)(E), the term "approved options specialist" or "approved market maker" means a specialist, market maker, or registered trader in options as referenced in paragraph (f)(2)(K) of this Rule, who is deemed a specialist for all purposes under the Exchange Act and who is registered pursuant to the rules of a national securities exchange.
- (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f)(10)(E), a permitted offset position means a position in the underlying asset or other related assets. Accordingly, a specialist or market maker may establish a long or short position in the assets underlying the options in which the specialist or market maker makes a market, or a security futures contract thereon, if the account holds the following permitted offset positions:
  - a. A "long" position in the underlying instrument or security futures contract offset by a "short" option position that is "in or at the money";
  - b. A "short" position in the underlying instrument or security futures contract offset by a "long" option position that is "in or at the money";
  - c. A stock position resulting from the assignment of a market-maker short option position or delivery in respect of a "short" security futures contract;
  - d. A stock position resulting from the exercise of a market maker "long" option position or taking delivery in respect of a long security futures contract;
    - e. A net "long" position in a security (other than an option) in which the market maker makes a market;
    - f. A net "short" position in a security (other than an option) in which the market maker makes a market; or
  - g. An offset position as defined in SEA Rule 15c3-1, including its appendices, or any applicable SEC staff interpretation or no-action position.
- (iii) For purposes of paragraphs (f)(10)(D) and (E), the term "in or at the money" means that the current market price of the underlying security is not more than two standard exercise intervals below (with respect to a call option) or above (with respect to a put option) the exercise price of the option; the term "in the money" means that the current market price of the underlying asset or index is not below (with respect to a call option) or above (with respect to a put option) the exercise price of the option; the term "overlying option" means a put option purchased or a call option written against a "long" position in an underlying asset; or a call option purchased, or a put option written against a "short" position in an underlying asset.
- (iv) Securities, including options and security futures contracts, in such accounts shall be valued conservatively in light of current market prices and the amount that might be realized upon liquidation. Substantial additional margin must be required or excess net capital maintained in all cases where the securities carried: (a) are subject to unusually rapid or violent changes in value including volatility in the expiration months of options or security futures contracts, (b) do not have an active market, or (c) in one or more or all accounts, including proprietary accounts combined, are such that they cannot be liquidated promptly or represent undue concentration of risk in view of the carrying member's net capital and its overall exposure to material loss.

#### (F) Approved Specialists' and Approved Market Makers' Accounts — Others

- (i) Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(2)(K), a member may carry the account of an "approved specialist" or "approved market maker" which account is limited to bona fide specialist or market making transactions including hedge transactions with security futures contracts upon a margin basis that is satisfactory to both parties. The amount of any deficiency between the equity in the account and haircut requirement pursuant to SEA Rule 15c3-1 and, if applicable, Rule 4110(a), shall be charged against the member's net capital when computing net capital under SEA Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 4110(a).
- (ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f)(10)(F), the term "approved specialist" or "approved market maker" means a specialist or market maker who is deemed a specialist or market maker for all purposes under the Exchange Act and who is registered pursuant to the rules of a national securities exchange.

#### (G) Additional Requirements

- (i) Money market mutual funds, as defined in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, can be used for satisfying margin requirements under this paragraph (f)(10), provided that the requirements of Rule 404(b) of SEC Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures and Rule 41.46(b)(2) under the CEA are satisfied.
- (ii) Day trading of security futures is subject to the minimum requirements of this Rule. If deemed a pattern day trader, the customer must maintain equity of \$25,000. The 20 percent requirement, for security futures contracts, should be calculated based on the greater of the initial or closing transaction and any amount exceeding FINRA excess must be collected. The creation of a customer call subjects the account to all the restrictions contained in paragraph (f)(8)(B) of this Rule.
- (iii) The use of the "time and tick" method is based on the member's ability to substantiate the validity of the system used. Lacking this ability dictates the use of the aggregate method.
  - (iv) Security futures contracts transacted or held in a futures account shall not be subject to any provision of this Rule.

#### (g) Portfolio Margin

As an alternative to the "strategy-based" margin requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this Rule, members may elect to apply the portfolio margin requirements set forth in this paragraph (g) to all margin equity securities, listed options, security futures products (as defined in Section 3(a)(56) of the Exchange Act), unlisted derivatives, warrants, stock index warrants, and related instruments (as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(D)), provided that the requirements of paragraph (g)(6)(B)(i) of this Rule are met. 1

In addition, a member, provided that it is a Futures Commission Merchant ("FCM") and is either a clearing member of a futures clearing organization or has an affiliate that is a clearing member of a futures clearing organization, is permitted under this paragraph (g) to combine an eligible participant's related instruments with listed index options, unlisted derivatives, options on exchange traded funds ("ETF"), stock index warrants and underlying instruments and compute a margin requirement for such combined products on a portfolio margin basis.

The portfolio margin provisions of this Rule shall not apply to Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs").

## (1) Monitoring

Members must monitor the risk of portfolio margin accounts and maintain a comprehensive written risk analysis methodology for assessing the potential risk to the member's capital over a specified range of possible market movements of positions maintained in such accounts. The risk analysis methodology shall specify the computations to be made, the frequency of computations, the records to be reviewed and maintained, and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the risk function. This risk analysis methodology must be filed with FINRA, or the member's designated examining authority ("DEA") if other than FINRA, and submitted to the SEC prior to the implementation of portfolio margining. In performing the risk analysis of portfolio margin accounts required by this Rule, each member shall include in the written risk analysis methodology procedures and guidelines for:

- (A) obtaining and reviewing the appropriate account documentation and financial information necessary for assessing the amount of credit to be extended to eligible participants;
- (B) the determination, review and approval of credit limits to each eligible participant, and across all eligible participants, utilizing a portfolio margin account;
- (C) monitoring credit risk exposure to the member from portfolio margin accounts, on both an intra-day and end of day basis, including the type, scope and frequency of reporting to senior management;
  - (D) the use of stress testing of portfolio margin accounts in order to monitor market risk exposure from individual accounts;
- (E) the regular review and testing of these risk analysis procedures by an independent unit such as internal audit or other comparable group;
  - (F) managing the impact of credit extended related to portfolio margin accounts on the member's overall risk exposure;
- (G) the appropriate response by management when limits on credit extensions related to portfolio margin accounts have been exceeded;
- (H) determining the need to collect additional margin from a particular eligible participant, including whether that determination was based upon the creditworthiness of the participant and/or the risk of the eligible product; and
- (I) monitoring the credit exposure resulting from concentrated positions within both individual portfolio margin accounts and across all portfolio margin accounts.

Moreover, management must periodically review, in accordance with written procedures, the member's credit extension activities for consistency with these guidelines. Management must periodically determine if the data necessary to apply this paragraph (g) is accessible on a timely basis and information systems are available to adequately capture, monitor, analyze and report relevant data.

- (2) Definitions For purposes of this paragraph (g), the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:
- (A) The term "listed option" means any equity-based or equity index-based option traded on a registered national securities exchange or issued and guaranteed by a registered clearing agency and shall include an OCC Cleared OTC Option (as defined in Rule 2360).
- (B) The term "portfolio" means any eligible product, as defined in paragraph (g)(6)(B)(i), grouped with its underlying instruments and related instruments.
- (C) The term "product group" means two or more portfolios of the same type (see table in paragraph (g)(2)(F) below) for which it has been determined by SEA Rule 15c3-1a that a percentage of offsetting profits may be applied to losses at the same valuation point.
- (D) The term "related instrument" within a security class or product group means broad-based index futures and options on broad-based index futures covering the same underlying instrument. The term "related instrument" does not include security futures products.
- (E) The term "security class" refers to all listed options, security futures products, unlisted derivatives, and related instruments covering the same underlying instrument and the underlying instrument itself.
- (F) The term "theoretical gains and losses" means the gain and loss in the value of individual eligible products and related instruments at ten equidistant intervals (valuation points) ranging from an assumed movement (both up and down) in the current market value of the underlying instrument. The magnitude of the valuation point range shall be as follows:

| Portfolio Type                                                                                    | Up / Down Market Move<br>(High & Low Valuation<br>Points) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 2<br>High Capitalization, Broad-based Market Index                                                | +6% / -8%                                                 |
| 3<br>Non-High Capitalization, Broad-based Market Index                                            | +/- 10%                                                   |
| Any other eligible product that is, or is based on, an equity security or a narrow-based<br>index | +/- 15%                                                   |

- (G) The term "underlying instrument" means a security or security index upon which any listed option, unlisted derivative, security future, or broad-based index future is based.
- (H) The term "unlisted derivative" means any equity-based or equity index-based option, forward contract, or security-based swap that can be valued by a theoretical pricing model approved by the SEC for valuing that type of option, forward contract, or security-based swap, and that is neither traded on a national securities exchange, nor issued and guaranteed by a registered clearing agency and shall not include an OCC Cleared OTC Option (as defined in Rule 2360).
- (3) Approved Theoretical Pricing Models Theoretical pricing models must be approved by the SEC.
- (4) Eligible Participants The application of the portfolio margin provisions of this paragraph (g) is limited to the following:
  - (A) any broker or dealer registered pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act;
- (B) any member of a national futures exchange to the extent that listed index options, unlisted derivatives, options on ETFs, stock index warrants or underlying instruments hedge the member's index futures; and
- (C) any person or entity not included in paragraphs (g)(4)(A) and (g)(4)(B) above approved for uncovered options and, if transactions in security futures are to be included in the account, approval for such transactions is also required. However, an eligible participant under this paragraph (g)(4)(C) may not establish or maintain positions in unlisted derivatives unless minimum equity of at least \$5 million is established and maintained with the member. For purposes of this minimum equity requirement, all securities and futures accounts carried by the member for the same eligible participant may be combined provided ownership across the accounts is identical. A guarantee pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this Rule is not permitted for purposes of the minimum equity requirement.

#### (5) Opening of Accounts

- (A) Members must notify and receive approval from FINRA, or the member's DEA if other than FINRA, prior to establishing a portfolio margin methodology for eligible participants.
- (B) Only eligible participants that have been approved to engage in uncovered short option contracts pursuant to Rule 2360, or the rules of the member's DEA if other than FINRA, are permitted to utilize a portfolio margin account. If eligible participants engage in security futures products transactions, approval from the member will also be required pursuant to Rule 2370.
  - (C) On or before the date of the initial transaction in a portfolio margin account, a member shall:
  - (i) furnish the eligible participant with a special written disclosure statement describing the nature and risks of portfolio margining which includes an acknowledgement for all portfolio margin account owners to sign, attesting that they have read and understood the disclosure statement, and agree to the terms under which a portfolio margin account is provided (see Rule 2360(c)); and
    - (ii) obtain the signed acknowledgement noted above from the eligible participant and record the date of receipt.

## (6) Establishing Account and Eligible Positions

(A) For purposes of applying the portfolio margin requirements prescribed in this paragraph (g), members are to establish and utilize a specific securities margin account, or sub-account of a margin account, clearly identified as a portfolio margin account that is separate from any other securities account carried for an eligible participant.

A margin deficit in the portfolio margin account of an eligible participant may not be considered as satisfied by excess equity in another account. Funds and/or securities must be transferred to the deficient account and a written record created and maintained. However, if a portfolio margin account is carried as a sub-account of a margin account, excess equity in the margin account (determined in accordance with the rules applicable to a margin account other than a portfolio margin account) may be used to satisfy a margin deficit in the portfolio margin sub-account without having to transfer any funds and/or securities.

## (B) Eligible Products

- (i) For eligible participants as described in paragraphs (g)(4)(A) through (g)(4)(C), a transaction in, or transfer of, an eligible product may be effected in the portfolio margin account. Eligible products under this paragraph (g) consist of:
  - a. a margin equity security (including a foreign equity security and option on a foreign equity security, provided the foreign equity security is deemed to have a "ready market" under SEA Rule 15c3-1 or a "no-action" position issued thereunder, and a control or restricted security, provided the security has met the requirements in a manner consistent with Securities Act Rule 144 or an SEC "no-action" position issued thereunder, sufficient enough to permit the sale of the security, upon exercise or assignment of any listed option or unlisted derivative written or held against it, without restriction);
    - b. a listed option on an equity security or index of equity securities;
    - c. a security futures product;
    - d. an unlisted derivative on an equity security or index of equity securities;
    - e. a warrant on an equity security or index of equity securities; and
    - f. a related instrument as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(D).

#### (7) Margin Required

The amount of margin required under this paragraph (g) for each portfolio shall be the greater of:

- (A) the amount for any of the ten equidistant valuation points representing the largest theoretical loss as calculated pursuant to paragraph (g)(8) below; or
- (B) for eligible participants as described in paragraph (g)(4)(A) through (g)(4)(C), \$.375 for each listed option, unlisted derivative, security future product, and related instrument, multiplied by the contract's or instrument's multiplier, not to exceed the market value in the case of long contracts in eligible products.
  - (C) Account guarantees pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this Rule are not permitted for purposes of meeting margin requirements.

- (D) Positions other than those listed in paragraph (g)(6)(B)(i) above are not eligible for portfolio margin treatment. However, positions not eligible for portfolio margin treatment (except for ineligible related instruments) may be carried in a portfolio margin account, provided the member has the ability to apply the applicable strategy-based margin requirements promulgated under this Rule, with the exception of securities subject to other provisions of paragraph (g). Shares of a money market mutual fund may be carried in a portfolio margin account, also subject to the applicable strategy-based margin requirement under this Rule provided that:
  - (i) the customer waives any right to redeem shares without the member's consent;
  - (ii) the member (or, if the shares are deposited with a clearing organization, the clearing organization) obtains the right to redeem shares in cash upon request;
  - (iii) the fund agrees to satisfy any conditions necessary or appropriate to ensure that the shares may be redeemed in cash, promptly upon request; and
    - (iv) the member complies with the requirements of Section 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and SEA Rule 11d1-2.
- (E) Non-margin eligible equity securities held "long" in a portfolio margin account shall be maintained at 100 percent of the current market value at all times. Non-margin eligible equity securities held "short" in a portfolio margin account shall be maintained at 50 percent of the current market value at all times.

# (8) Method of Calculation

- (A) Long and short positions in eligible products, including underlying instruments and related instruments, are to be grouped by security class; each security class group being a "portfolio." Each portfolio is categorized as one of the portfolio types specified in paragraph (g)(2)(F) above, as applicable.
- (B) For each portfolio, theoretical gains and losses are calculated for each position as specified in paragraph (g)(2)(F) above. For purposes of determining the theoretical gains and losses at each valuation point, members shall obtain and utilize the theoretical values of eligible products as described in this paragraph (g) rendered by an approved theoretical pricing model.
- (C) Offsets. Within each portfolio, theoretical gains and losses may be netted fully at each valuation point. Offsets between portfolios within the eligible product groups, as described in paragraph (g)(2)(F), may then be applied as permitted by SEA Rule 15c3-1a.
- (D) After applying the offsets above, the sum of the greatest loss from each portfolio is computed to arrive at the total margin required for the account (subject to the per contract minimum).
- (E) In addition, if a security that is convertible, exchangeable, or exercisable into a security that is an underlying instrument requires the payment of money or would result in a loss if converted, exchanged, or exercised at the time when the security is deemed an underlying instrument, the full amount of the conversion loss is required.

# (9) Portfolio Margin Minimum Equity Deficiency

- (A) If, as of the close of business, the equity in the portfolio margin account of an eligible participant as described in paragraph (g) (4)(C), declines below the \$5 million minimum equity required, if applicable, and is not restored to at least \$5 million within three business days by a deposit of funds and/or securities or through favorable market action, members are prohibited from accepting new opening orders beginning on the fourth business day, except that new opening orders entered for the purpose of reducing market risk may be accepted if the result would be to lower margin requirements. This prohibition shall remain in effect until,
  - (i) equity of \$5 million is established, or
  - (ii) all unlisted derivatives are liquidated or transferred from the portfolio margin account to the appropriate securities account.
- (B) Members will not be permitted to deduct any portfolio margin minimum equity deficiency amount from net capital in lieu of collecting the minimum equity required.

## (10) Portfolio Margin Deficiency

- (A) If, as of the close of business, the equity in the portfolio margin account of an eligible participant, as described in paragraph (g) (4)(A) through (g)(4)(C), is less than the margin required, the eligible participant may deposit additional funds and/or securities or establish a hedge to meet the margin requirement within three business days. After the three business day period, members are prohibited from accepting new opening orders, except that new opening orders entered for the purpose of reducing market risk may be accepted if the result would be to lower margin requirements. In the event an eligible participant fails to hedge existing positions or deposit additional funds and/or securities in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficiency after three business days, the member must liquidate positions in an amount sufficient to, at a minimum, lower the total margin required to an amount less than or equal to the account equity.
- (B) If the portfolio margin deficiency is not met by the close of business on the next business day after the business day on which such deficiency arises, members will be required to deduct the amount of the deficiency from net capital until such time the deficiency is satisfied or positions are liquidated pursuant to paragraph (g)(10)(A) above.
- (C) Members will not be permitted to deduct any portfolio margin deficiency amount from net capital in lieu of collecting the margin required.
- (D) FINRA, or the member's DEA if other than FINRA, may grant additional time for an eligible participant to meet a portfolio margin deficiency upon written request, which is expected to be granted in extraordinary circumstances only.
- (E) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) above, members should not permit an eligible participant to make a practice of meeting a portfolio margin deficiency by liquidation. Members must have procedures in place to identify accounts that periodically liquidate positions to eliminate margin deficiencies, and the member is expected to take appropriate action when warranted. Liquidation to eliminate margin deficiencies that are caused solely by adverse price movements may be disregarded.

# (11) Determination of Value for Margin Purposes

For the purposes of this paragraph (g), all eligible products shall be valued at current market prices. Account equity for the purposes of paragraphs (g)(9)(A) and (g)(10)(A) shall be calculated separately for each portfolio margin account by adding the current market value of all long positions, subtracting current market value of all short positions, and adding the credit (or subtracting the debit) balance in the account.

## (12) Net Capital Treatment of Portfolio Margin Accounts

- (A) No member that requires margin in any portfolio account pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Rule shall permit the aggregate portfolio margin requirements to exceed ten times its net capital for any period exceeding three business days. The member shall, beginning on the fourth business day, cease opening new portfolio margin accounts until compliance is achieved.
- (B) If, at any time, a member's aggregate portfolio margin requirements exceed ten times its net capital, the member shall immediately transmit telegraphic or facsimile notice of such deficiency to the principal office of the SEC in Washington, D.C., the district or regional office of the SEC for the district or region in which the member maintains its principal place of business; and to FINRA, or the member's DEA if other than FINRA. The notice to FINRA shall be in such form as FINRA may prescribe.
- (13) Day Trading Requirements The day trading restrictions promulgated under paragraph (f)(8)(B) of this Rule shall not apply to portfolio margin accounts that establish and maintain at least \$5 million in equity, provided that a member has the ability to monitor the intra-day risk associated with day trading. Portfolio margin accounts that do not establish and maintain at least \$5 million in equity will be subject to the day trading restrictions under paragraph (f)(8)(B) of this Rule, provided the member has the ability to apply the applicable day trading requirement under this Rule. However, if the position or positions day traded were part of a hedge strategy, the day trading restrictions will not apply. A "hedge strategy" for purposes of this Rule means a transaction or a series of transactions that reduces or offsets a material portion of the risk in a portfolio. Members are expected to monitor these portfolio margin accounts to detect and prevent circumvention of the day trading requirements. In the event day trades executed in a portfolio margin account exceed the day-trading buying power, the day trade margin deficiency that is created must be met by the deposit of cash and/or securities within three business days.

#### (14) Requirements to Liquidate

- (A) A member is required immediately either to liquidate, or transfer to another broker-dealer eligible to carry portfolio margin accounts, all portfolio margin accounts with positions in related instruments if the member is:
  - (i) insolvent as defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, or is unable to meet its obligations as they mature;
  - (ii) the subject of a proceeding pending in any court or before any agency of the United States or any State in which a receiver, trustee, or liquidator for such debtor has been appointed;
  - (iii) not in compliance with applicable requirements under the Exchange Act or rules of the SEC or any self-regulatory organization with respect to financial responsibility or hypothecation of eligible participant's securities; or
  - (iv) unable to make such computations as may be necessary to establish compliance with such financial responsibility or hypothecation rules.
- (B) Nothing in this paragraph (g)(14) shall be construed as limiting or restricting in any way the exercise of any right of a registered clearing agency to liquidate or cause the liquidation of positions in accordance with its by-laws and rules.
- (15) Members must ensure that portfolio accounts are in compliance with Rule 2360.

## (h) Margin Requirement Exception for Certain Members.

Any member designated to another self-regulatory organization for oversight of the member's compliance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, and self-regulatory organization rules under SEA Rule 17d-1 is exempt from the provisions of Rule 4210.
