Subparagraph (ii) will not prevent a member from publishing or otherwise distributing a research report pursuant to Securities Act Rule 139 regarding a subject company with "actively-traded securities," as defined in Rule 101(c)(1) of SEC Regulation M, and will not prevent a research analyst from making a public appearance concerning such a company.

- (J) restrict or limit research analyst account trading in securities, any derivatives of such securities and funds whose performance is materially dependent upon the performance of securities covered by the research analyst, including:
  - (i) ensuring that research analyst accounts, supervisors of research analysts and associated persons with the ability to influence the content of research reports do not benefit in their trading from knowledge of the content or timing of a research report before the intended recipients of such research have had a reasonable opportunity to act on the information in the research report;
  - (ii) providing that no research analyst account may purchase or sell any security or any option on or derivative of such security in a manner inconsistent with the research analyst's recommendation as reflected in the most recent research report published by the member, and defining financial hardship circumstances, if any (e.g., unanticipated significant change in the personal financial circumstances of the beneficial owner of the research analyst account), in which the member will permit a research analyst account to trade in a manner inconsistent with such research analyst's most recently published recommendation; and
  - (iii) prohibiting a research analyst account from purchasing or receiving any security before an issuer's initial public offering if the issuer is principally engaged in the same types of business as companies that the research analyst follows;
- (K) prohibit explicit or implicit promises of favorable research, a particular research rating or recommendation or specific research content as inducement for the receipt of business or compensation;

- (E) if the subject company is, or over the 12-month period preceding the date of publication or distribution of the research report has been, a client of the member, and if so, the types of services provided to the issuer.

#### (f) Termination of Coverage

A member must promptly notify its customers if it intends to terminate coverage of a subject company. Such notice must be made using the member's ordinary means to disseminate research reports on the subject company to its various customers. The notice must be accompanied by a final research report, comparable in scope and detail to prior research reports, and include a final recommendation or rating. If impracticable to provide a final research report, recommendation or rating, a member must disclose to its customers its reason for terminating coverage.

#### (g) Distribution of Member Research Reports

A member must establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that a research report is not distributed selectively to internal trading personnel or a particular customer or class of customers in advance of other customers that the member has previously determined are entitled to receive the research report.

#### (h) Distribution of Third-Party Research Reports

- (1) Subject to paragraph (h)(5), a registered principal or supervisory analyst approved pursuant to Incorporated Rule 1220(a)(14) must review for compliance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (h) and approve by signature or initial all third-party research reports distributed by a member.

- (3) A member must establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that any third-party research it distributes contains no untrue statement of material fact and is otherwise not false or misleading. For the purposes of this paragraph (h)(3) only, a member's obligation to review a third-party research report extends to any untrue statement of material fact or any false or misleading information that:
  - (A) should be known from reading the report; or
  - (B) is known based on information otherwise possessed by the member.
- (4) A member must accompany any third-party research report it distributes with, or provide a web address that directs a recipient to, disclosure of any material conflict of interest that can reasonably be expected to have influenced the choice of a third-party research provider or the subject company of a third-party research report, including the disclosures required by paragraphs (c)(4)(C), (c)(4)(F), (c)(4)(G) and (c)(4)(I) of this Rule.

### (i) Exemption for Members with Limited Investment Banking Activity

The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F) and (G) shall not apply to members that over the previous three years, on average per year, have participated in 10 or fewer investment banking services transactions as manager or co-manager and generated \$5 million or less in gross investment banking revenues from those transactions; provided, however, that with respect to paragraph (b)(2)(G), such members must establish information barriers or other institutional safeguards reasonably designed to ensure that research analysts are insulated from pressure by persons engaged in investment banking services activities or other persons, including sales and trading personnel, who might be biased in their judgment or supervision. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), the term "investment banking services transactions" include the underwriting of both corporate debt and equity securities but not municipal securities. Members that qualify for this exemption must maintain records sufficient to establish eligibility for the exemption and also maintain for at least three years any communication that, but for this exemption, would be subject to paragraphs (b)(2)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F) and (G).

#### (j) Exemption for Good Cause

Pursuant to the Rule 9600 Series, FINRA may in exceptional and unusual circumstances, conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any requirement of this Rule for good cause shown after taking into account all relevant factors, to the extent such exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Rule, the protection of investors, and the public interest.

## • • • Supplementary Material: --------------

#### .01 Efforts to Solicit Investment Banking Business

(a) FINRA interprets paragraph (b)(2)(L)(i) to prohibit in pitch materials any information about a member's research capacity in a manner that suggests, directly or indirectly, that the member might provide favorable research coverage. For example, FINRA would consider the publication in a pitch book or related materials of an analyst's industry ranking to imply the potential outcome of future research because of the manner in which such rankings are compiled. On the other hand, a member would be permitted to include in the pitch materials the fact of coverage and the name of the research analyst because such information alone does not imply favorable coverage.

Members must consider whether the facts and circumstances of any solicitation or engagement would warrant disclosure under Section 17(b) of the Securities Act.

- (b) Paragraph (b)(2)(L)(i) shall not prevent a research analyst from attending a pitch meeting in connection with an initial public offering of an Emerging Growth Company that also is attended by investment banking personnel; provided, however, that a research analyst may not engage in otherwise prohibited conduct in such meetings, including efforts to solicit investment banking business.
- .02 Joint Due Diligence. FINRA interprets paragraph (b)(1)(C) to prohibit the performance of joint due diligence (i.e., confirming the adequacy of disclosure in offering or other disclosure documents for a transaction) by the research analyst in the presence of investment banking department personnel prior to the selection by the issuer of the underwriters for the investment banking services transaction.

### .03 Restrictions on Communications with Customers and Internal Personnel

- (a) Consistent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(M) of this Rule, no research analyst may engage in any communication with a current or prospective customer in the presence of investment banking department personnel or company management about an investment banking services transaction.
- (b) FINRA interprets paragraph (b)(1)(C) of this Rule to require that any written or oral communication by a research analyst with a current or prospective customer or internal personnel related to an investment banking services transaction must be fair, balanced and not misleading, taking into consideration the overall context in which the communication is made.
- .04 Disclosure of Non-Investment Banking Services Compensation. A member may satisfy the disclosure requirement in paragraph (c)(4)(D) with respect to receipt of non-investment banking services compensation by an affiliate by implementing policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the research analyst and associated persons of the member with the ability to influence the content of research reports from directly or indirectly receiving information from the affiliate as to whether the affiliate received such compensation. However, a member must disclose receipt of non-investment banking services compensation by its affiliates from the subject company in the past 12 months when the research analyst or an associated person with the ability to influence the content of a research report has actual knowledge that an affiliate received such compensation during that time period.

.05 Submission of Sections of a Draft Research Reports for Factual Review. Consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(A) and (b) (2)(N), sections of a draft research report may be provided to non-investment banking personnel or to the subject company for factual review so long as:

- (a) the sections of the report submitted do not contain the research summary, the research rating or the price target;
- (b) a complete draft of the report is provided to legal or compliance personnel before sections of the report are submitted to noninvestment banking personnel or the subject company; and
- (c) if, after submitting sections of the report to non-investment banking personnel or the subject company, the research department intends to change the proposed rating or price target, it must first provide written justification to, and receive written authorization from, legal or compliance personnel for the change. The member must retain copies of any draft and the final version of such report for three years after publication.
- .06 Beneficial Ownership of Equity Securities. With respect to paragraphs (c)(4)(F) and (d)(1)(B), beneficial ownership of any class of common equity securities shall be computed in accordance with the same standards used to compute ownership for purposes of the reporting requirements under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
- .07 Distribution of Member Research Products. With respect to paragraph (g), a member may provide different research products and services to different classes of customers. For example, a member may offer one research product for those with a long-term investment horizon ("investor research") and a different research product for those customers with a short-term investment horizon ("trading research"). These products may lead to different recommendations or ratings, provided that each is consistent with the meaning of the member's ratings system for each respective product. However, a member may not differentiate a research product based on the timing of receipt of a recommendation, rating or other potentially market moving information, nor may a member label a research product with substantially the same content as a different product as a means to allow certain customers to trade in advance of other customers. In addition, a member that provides different research products and services for different customers must inform its other customers that its alternative research products and services may reach different conclusions or recommendations that could impact the price of the equity security. Thus, for example, a member that offers trading research must inform its investment research customers that its trading research product may contain different recommendations or ratings that could result in short-term price movements contrary to the recommendation in its investment research.
- .08 Ability to Influence the Content of a Research Report. For the purposes of this Rule, an associated person with the ability to influence the content of a research report is an associated person who is required to review the content of the research report or has exercised authority to review or change the research report prior to publication or distribution. This term does not include legal or compliance personnel who may review a research report for compliance purposes but are not authorized to dictate a particular recommendation, rating or price target.
- .09 Obligations of Persons Associated with a Member. Consistent with Rule 0140, persons associated with a member must comply with such member's written policies and procedures as established pursuant to this Rule 2241. In addition, consistent with Rule 0140, it shall be a violation of this Rule for an associated person to engage in the restricted or prohibited conduct to be addressed through the establishment, maintenance and enforcement of policies and procedures required by this Rule or related Supplementary Material.
- .10 Divesting Research Analyst Holdings. With respect to paragraph (b)(2)(J)(ii), FINRA shall not consider a research analyst account to have traded in a manner inconsistent with a research analyst's recommendation where a member has instituted a policy that prohibits any research analyst from holding securities, or options on or derivatives of such securities, of the companies in the research analyst's coverage universe; provided that the member establishes a reasonable plan to liquidate such holdings consistent with the principles in paragraph (b)(2)(J)(i) and such plan is approved by the member's legal or compliance department.
