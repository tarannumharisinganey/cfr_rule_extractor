# 5131.NewIssueAllocations andDistributions

## (a) Quid Pro Quo Allocations

No member or person associated with a member may offer or threaten to withhold shares it allocates of a new issue as consideration or inducement for the receipt of compensation that is excessive in relation to the services provided by the member.

#### (b) Spinning

- (1) No member or person associated with a member may allocate shares of a new issue to any account in which an executive officer or director of a public company or a covered non-public company, or a person materially supported by such executive officer or director, has a beneficial interest:
  - (A) if the company is currently an investment banking services client of the member or the member has received compensation from the company for investment banking services in the past 12 months;
  - (B) if the person responsible for making the allocation decision knows or has reason to know that the member intends to provide, or expects to be retained by the company for, investment banking services within the next 3 months; or
  - (C) on the express or implied condition that such executive officer or director, on behalf of the company, will retain the member for the performance of future investment banking services.
- (2) The prohibitions in this paragraph shall not apply to allocations of shares of a new issue to any account described in Rule 5130(c)(1) through (3) and (5) through (12), or to any other account in which the beneficial interests of executive officers and directors of the company and persons materially supported by such executive officers and directors in the aggregate do not exceed 25% of such account.

# (c) Policies Concerning Flipping

- (1) No member or person associated with a member may directly or indirectly recoup, or attempt to recoup, any portion of a commission or credit paid or awarded to an associated person for selling shares of a new issue that are subsequently flipped by a customer, unless the managing underwriter has assessed a penalty bid on the entire syndicate.
- (2) In addition to any obligation to maintain records relating to penalty bids under SEA Rule 17a-2(c)(1), a member shall promptly record and maintain information regarding any penalties or disincentives assessed on its associated persons in connection with a penalty bid.

## (d) New Issue Pricing and Trading Practices

In a new issue:

- (1) Reports of Indications of Interest and Final Allocations. The book-running lead manager must provide to the issuer's pricing committee (or, if the issuer has no pricing committee, its board of directors):
  - (A) a regular report of indications of interest, including the names of interested institutional investors and the number of shares indicated by each, as reflected in the book-running lead manager's book of potential institutional orders, and a report of aggregate demand from retail investors;
  - (B) after the settlement date of the new issue, a report of the final allocation of shares to institutional investors as reflected in the books and records of the book-running lead manager including the names of purchasers and the number of shares purchased by each, and aggregate sales to retail investors;
- (2) Lock-Up Agreements. Any lock-up agreement or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares by officers and directors of the issuer entered into in connection with a new issue shall provide that:
  - (A) Any lock-up agreement or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares by officers and directors of the issuer shall provide that such restrictions will apply to their issuer-directed shares; and
  - (B) At least two business days before the release or waiver of any lock-up or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares, the book-running lead manager will notify the issuer of the impending release or waiver and announce the impending release or waiver through a major news service, except where the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer of securities that is not for consideration or that is to an immediate family member as defined in Rule 5130(i)(5) and where the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same lock-up agreement terms in place for the transferor;

- (3) Agreement Among Underwriters. The agreement between the book-running lead manager and other syndicate members must require, to the extent not inconsistent with SEC Regulation M, that any shares trading at a premium to the public offering price that are returned by a purchaser to a syndicate member after secondary market trading commences:
  - (A) be used to offset the existing syndicate short position, or
  - (B) if no syndicate short position exists, the member must either:
  - (i) offer returned shares at the public offering price to unfilled customers' orders pursuant to a random allocation methodology, or
  - (ii) sell returned shares on the secondary market and donate profits from the sale to an unaffiliated charitable organization with the condition that the donation be treated as an anonymous donation to avoid any reputational benefit to the member.
- (4) Market Orders. No member may accept a market order for the purchase of shares of a new issue in the secondary market prior to the commencement of trading of such shares in the secondary market.

#### (f) Exemptive Relief

Pursuant to the Rule 9600 Series, FINRA may in exceptional and unusual circumstances, taking into consideration all relevant factors, exempt a person unconditionally or on specified terms from any or all of the provisions of this Rule that it deems appropriate consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.

### • • • Supplementary Material: --------------

.01 Issuer Directed Allocations. The prohibitions of paragraph (b) above shall not apply to allocations of securities that are directed in writing by the issuer, an affiliate of the issuer, or a selling shareholder, so long as the member has no involvement or influence, directly or indirectly, in the allocation decisions of the issuer, an affiliate, or a selling shareholder with respect to such issuer-directed securities.

#### .02 Written Representations.

- (a) Annual Representation. For the purposes of Rule 5131(b), a member may rely upon a written representation obtained within the prior 12 months from the beneficial owner(s) of the account, or a person authorized to represent the beneficial owner(s) of the account, as to whether such beneficial owner(s) is an executive officer or director or person materially supported by an executive officer or director and if so, the company(ies) on whose behalf such executive officer or director serves.
- (b) Indirect Beneficial Owners. For the purposes of Rule 5131(b), a member may rely upon a written representation obtained within the prior 12 months from a person authorized to represent an account that does not look through to the beneficial owners of any unaffiliated private fund invested in the account, except for beneficial owners that are control persons of the investment adviser to such private fund, that such unaffiliated private fund:
  - (1) is managed by an investment adviser;
  - (2) has assets greater than \$50 million;
  - (3) owns less than 25% of the account and is not a fund in which a single investor has a beneficial interest of 25% or more; and
  - (4) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the account.

An unaffiliated private fund is a "private fund," as defined in Section 202(a)(29) of the Investment Advisers Act, whose investment adviser does not have a control person in common with the investment adviser to the account. A control person of an investment adviser is a person with direct or indirect "control" over the investment adviser, as that term is defined in Form ADV.

- (c) A member may not rely upon any representation that it believes, or has reason to believe, is inaccurate. A member shall maintain a copy of all records and information relating to whether an account is eligible to receive an allocation of the new issue under Rule 5131(b) in its files for at least three years following the member's allocation to that account.
- .03 Lock-up Announcements. For the purposes of this Rule, the requirement that the book-running lead manager announce the impending release or waiver of a lock-up or other restriction on the transfer of the issuer's shares shall be deemed satisfied where such announcement is made by the book-running lead manager, another member or the issuer, so long as such announcement otherwise complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this Rule. In addition, the disclosure of a release or waiver in a publicly filed registration statement in connection with a secondary offering satisfies the requirement for an announcement through a major news service.
- .04 Anti-Dilution Provisions. The prohibitions of paragraph (b) above shall not apply to an account in which an executive officer or director of a public company or a covered non-public company, or a person materially supported by such executive officer or director, has a beneficial interest that meets the following conditions:
- (a) the account has held an equity ownership interest in the issuer, or a company that has been acquired by the issuer in the past year, for a period of one year prior to the effective date of the offering;
- (b) the allocation of the new issue to the account shall not increase the account's percentage equity ownership in the issuer above the ownership level as of three months prior to the filing of the registration statement in connection with the offering;
  - (c) the allocation of the new issue to the account shall not include any special terms; and
- (d) the new issue allocated pursuant to this Supplementary Material .04 shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a period of three months following the effective date of the offering.
- .05 Application to Foreign Non-Member Broker-Dealers Participating in an Underwriting Syndicate. The prohibitions of paragraph (b) above shall not apply to a foreign non-member broker-dealer that is participating in an underwriting syndicate for the sale of a new issue (which underwriting syndicate may include a member affiliate of the non-member broker-dealer) and allocating new issue securities to a non-U.S. person, provided that such allocation decision is not made at the direction or request of a member or an associated person of a member.
