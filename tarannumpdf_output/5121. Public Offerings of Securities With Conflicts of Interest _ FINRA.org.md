    - (B) the securities offered have a bona fide public market; or
  - (C) the securities offered are investment grade rated or are securities in the same series that have equal rights and obligations as investment grade rated securities.

- (2) Any member offering its securities pursuant to this Rule shall immediately notify FINRA when the public offering has been terminated and settlement effected and shall file with FINRA a computation of its net capital computed pursuant to the provisions of SEA Rule 15c3-1 (the net capital rule) as of the settlement date. If at such time its net capital ratio as so computed is more than 10:1 or, net capital fails to equal 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by Rule 15c3-1 or, in the event the member calculates its net capital requirement using the alternative standard (set forth in Rule 15c3-1(a)(1)(ii)), its net capital is less than seven percent of aggregate debit items as computed in accordance with Rule 15c3-3a, all monies received from sales of securities of the public offering must be returned in full to the purchasers thereof and the offering withdrawn, unless the member has obtained from the SEC a specific exemption from the net capital rule. Proceeds from the sales of securities in the public offering may be taken into consideration in computing net capital ratio for purposes of this paragraph.
