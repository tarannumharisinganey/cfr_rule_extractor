*Website or online service directed to children* means a commercial website or online service, or portion thereof, that is targeted to children.

- (1) In determining whether a website or online service, or a portion thereof, is directed to children, the Commission will consider its subject matter, visual content, use of animated characters or childoriented activities and incentives, music or other audio content, age of models, presence of child celebrities or celebrities who appeal to children, language or other characteristics of the website or online service, as well as whether advertising promoting or appearing on the website or online service is directed to children. The Commission will also consider competent and reliable empirical evidence regarding audience composition and evidence regarding the intended audience, including marketing or promotional materials or plans, representations to consumers or to third parties, reviews by users or third parties, and the age of users on similar websites or services.
- (2) A website or online service shall be deemed directed to children when it has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information directly from users of another website or online service directed to children.

- (3) A mixed audience website or online service shall not be deemed directed to children with regard to any visitor not identified as under 13.
- (4) A website or online service shall not be deemed directed to children solely because it refers or links to a commercial website or online service directed to children by using information location tools, including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link.

- (a) *General requirements.*
  - (1) An operator is required to obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children, including consent to any material change in the collection, use, or disclosure practices to which the parent has previously consented.
  - (2) An operator must give the parent the option to consent to the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting to disclosure of his or her personal information to third parties, unless such disclosure is integral to the website or online service. An operator required to give the parent this option must obtain separate verifiable parental consent to such disclosure.
- <span id="page-7-4"></span><span id="page-7-2"></span><span id="page-7-1"></span>(b) *Methods for verifiable parental consent.*
  - (1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent must be reasonably calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child's parent.
  - (2) Existing methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include:
    - (i) Providing a consent form to be signed by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic scan;
    - (ii) Requiring a parent, in connection with a transaction, to use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder;
    - (iii) Having a parent call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel;
    - (iv) Having a parent connect to trained personnel via video-conference;
    - (v) Verifying a parent's identity by checking a form of government-issued identification against databases of such information, where the parent's identification is deleted by the operator from its records promptly after such verification is complete;

- (vi) Verifying a parent's identity using knowledge-based authentication provided:
  - (A) the verification process uses dynamic, multiple-choice questions, where there are a reasonable number of questions with an adequate number of possible answers such that the probability of correctly guessing the answers is low; and
  - (B) the questions are of sufficient difficulty that a child age 12 or younger in the parent's household could not reasonably ascertain the answers;
- (vii) Having a parent submit a government-issued photographic identification that is verified to be authentic and is compared against an image of the parent's face taken with a phone camera or webcam using facial recognition technology and confirmed by personnel trained to confirm that the photos match; provided that the parent's identification and images are promptly deleted by the operator from its records after the match is confirmed; or
- (viii) Provided that, an operator that does not "disclose" (as defined by [§ 312.2](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-11-17/title-16/section-312.2/)) children's personal information, may use an email coupled with additional steps to provide assurances that the person providing the consent is the parent. Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory email to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier email.
- (ix) Provided that, an operator that does not "disclose" (as defined by [§ 312.2](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-11-17/title-16/section-312.2/)) children's personal information, may use a text message coupled with additional steps to provide assurances that the person providing the consent is the parent. Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory text message to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier text message.
- <span id="page-8-3"></span>(3) *Safe harbor approval of parental consent methods.* A safe harbor program approved by the Commission under [§ 312.11](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-11-17/title-16/section-312.11/) may approve its member operators' use of a parental consent method not currently enumerated in [paragraph \(b\)\(2\)](#page-7-1) of this section where the safe harbor program determines that such parental consent method meets the requirements of [paragraph \(b\)\(1\)](#page-7-2) of this section.
- <span id="page-8-2"></span><span id="page-8-1"></span><span id="page-8-0"></span>(c) *Exceptions to prior parental consent.* Verifiable parental consent is required prior to any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from a child except as set forth in this paragraph:

In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to ensure that the parent receives notice as described in [§ 312.4\(c\)\(2\);](#page-5-0)

- <span id="page-9-1"></span>(3) Where the sole purpose of collecting online contact information from a child is to respond directly on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child, and where such information is not used to recontact the child or for any other purpose, is not disclosed, and is deleted by the operator from its records promptly after responding to the child's request;
- <span id="page-9-2"></span>(4) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's online contact information is to respond directly more than once to the child's specific request, and where such information is not used for any other purpose, disclosed, or combined with any other information collected from the child. In such cases, the operator must make reasonable efforts, taking into consideration available technology, to ensure that the parent receives notice as described in [§ 312.4\(c\)\(3\)](#page-5-1). An operator will not be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent receives notice where the notice to the parent was unable to be delivered;
- <span id="page-9-3"></span>(5) Where the purpose of collecting a child's and a parent's name and online contact information, is to protect the safety of a child, and where such information is not used or disclosed for any purpose unrelated to the child's safety.

- (8) Where an operator covered under paragraph (2) of the definition of *website or online service directed to children* in [§ 312.2](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-11-17/title-16/section-312.2/) collects a persistent identifier and no other personal information from a user who affirmatively interacts with the operator and whose previous registration with that operator indicates that such user is not a child. In such case, there also shall be no obligation to provide notice under [§ 312.4](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-11-17/title-16/section-312.4/); or
- <span id="page-9-5"></span>(9) Where an operator collects an audio file containing a child's voice, and no other personal information, for use in responding to a child's specific request and where the operator does not use such information for any other purpose, does not disclose it, and deletes it immediately after responding to the child's request.
