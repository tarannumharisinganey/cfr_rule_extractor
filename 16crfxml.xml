- (c) Provide a reasonable means for a parent to review the personal information collected from a child and to refuse to permit its further use or maintenance (§ 312.6);
- (d) Not condition a child's participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or another activity on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity \(§ 312.7\); and

        <text>- (a) *General requirements.*
  - (1) An operator is required to obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children, including consent to any material change in the collection, use, or disclosure practices to which the parent has previously consented.
  - (2) An operator must give the parent the option to consent to the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting to disclosure of his or her personal information to third parties, unless such disclosure is integral to the website or online service. An operator required to give the parent this option must obtain separate verifiable parental consent to such disclosure.
- (b) *Methods for verifiable parental consent.*
  - (1) An operator must make reasonable efforts to obtain verifiable parental consent, taking into consideration available technology. Any method to obtain verifiable parental consent must be reasonably calculated, in light of available technology, to ensure that the person providing consent is the child's parent.
  - (2) Existing methods to obtain verifiable parental consent that satisfy the requirements of this paragraph include:
    - (i) Providing a consent form to be signed by the parent and returned to the operator by postal mail, facsimile, or electronic scan;
    - (ii) Requiring a parent, in connection with a transaction, to use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each discrete transaction to the primary account holder;
    - (iii) Having a parent call a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained personnel;
    - (iv) Having a parent connect to trained personnel via video-conference;
    - (v) Verifying a parent's identity by checking a form of government-issued identification against databases of such information, where the parent's identification is deleted by the operator from its records promptly after such verification is complete;

- (vi) Verifying a parent's identity using knowledge-based authentication provided:
  - (A) the verification process uses dynamic, multiple-choice questions, where there are a reasonable number of questions with an adequate number of possible answers such that the probability of correctly guessing the answers is low; and
  - (B) the questions are of sufficient difficulty that a child age 12 or younger in the parent's household could not reasonably ascertain the answers;
- (vii) Having a parent submit a government-issued photographic identification that is verified to be authentic and is compared against an image of the parent's face taken with a phone camera or webcam using facial recognition technology and confirmed by personnel trained to confirm that the photos match; provided that the parent's identification and images are promptly deleted by the operator from its records after the match is confirmed; or
- (viii) Provided that, an operator that does not &quot;disclose&quot; (as defined by § 312.2) children's personal information, may use an email coupled with additional steps to provide assurances that the person providing the consent is the parent. Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory email to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier email.
- (ix) Provided that, an operator that does not &quot;disclose&quot; (as defined by § 312.2) children's personal information, may use a text message coupled with additional steps to provide assurances that the person providing the consent is the parent. Such additional steps include: Sending a confirmatory text message to the parent following receipt of consent, or obtaining a postal address or telephone number from the parent and confirming the parent's consent by letter or telephone call. An operator that uses this method must provide notice that the parent can revoke any consent given in response to the earlier text message.
